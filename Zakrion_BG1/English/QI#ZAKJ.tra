@0 = ~Do you use that line when the guards inquire about this place? I'd hope not.~
@1 = ~Now, I know not to buy booze for my future crew mates. When the booze is gone, they'll think I'm a terrible captain for not getting more.~
@2 = ~Yikes, you'd think if you're having a fling with a married person, you'd at least have some contraception.~
@3 = ~There goes my hopes and dreams of being adopted by a dwarven family.~
@4 = ~We need to get this man his dagger.~
@5 = ~No one ever believes children when they see something out of the ordinary, but they're so innocent. How can they make up something so terrifying on their own?~
@6 = ~Almost sounds like they've been expecting us.~
@7 = ~This day keeps getting weirder and weider.~
@8 = ~What's that saying that's been going around lately? Relaxing is for the weak?~
@9 = ~The pirate Black Alaric's treasure... sounds tempting.~
@10 = ~I got this one, <CHARNAME>.~
@11 = ~A fish with no eyes is just a fsh.~
@12 = ~Aye, mate! Yer stealin' me glory!~
@13 = ~Sorry, mate, but I'm not about to be called a landlubber by you. Besides, it's a common joke around the sailors.~
@14 = ~Step up your game, mate.~
@15 = ~Your ship would make history books if you outsailed Balduran.~
@16 = ~I haven't seen it in any yet.~
@17 = ~And that's why laws are so fickle. You feel like something is wrong, but you can't do anything about it.~
@18 = ~You'll be swallowing our blades, cur.~
@19 = ~Why in the Nine Hells do we run into people like them?~
@20 = ~For fuck's sake...~
@21 = ~It seems like you're moving up in the world, <CHARNAME>.~
@22 = ~Or, further down if you want to look at it that way.~
@23 = ~Don't pay him fifteen pieces of gold. We might as well get more exercise in walking around and exploring the city by ourselves.~
@24 = ~That's no way to greet a new person.~
@25 = ~You're an ugly bastard, too!~
@26 = ~<CHARNAME>, please handle this idiot before I get my hands on him.~
@27 = ~If all I needed to do in life was give the right name to pass through maximum security, I better start learning everyone's names.~
@28 = ~I don't know about you, <CHARNAME>, but tying up loose ends isn't always a bad thing.~
@29 = ~No, please, no! I'm just his apprentice, I really don't know anything. Only a little!~
@30 = ~Yeah, that's politics for you. Hells, that's society for you.~
@31 = ~Hmph!~
@32 = ~Hmph. I'd like to order something too, though.~
@33 = ~I'm sorry, good sir, but there were other people in line before you. You will have to wait for at least a few hours.~
@34 = ~A few hours? That's not happening. <CHARNAME>, there's no point talking to the waiter right now.~
@35 = ~It's hard seeing people go, but it's harder to die alone.~
@36 = ~You've perfect timing, <CHARNAME>.~
@37 = ~I would pay good coin to see the look on Blackstaff's reaction to your... excitement.~
@38 = ~Wow, I didn't know this actually happened in real life.~
@39 = ~Next, there will be a sale for servant statues that need to be freed, and their reward will be doing your laundry for the rest of their lives.~
@40 = ~Great, the living dead is amongst us.~
@41 = ~Sure, sure. Give up all your money. You won't be starving and eventually die from the hunger.~
@42 = ~I'd rather die a quick and painful death than slowly wasting away.~
@43 = ~Shut up! I'm not talking to you, I'm speaking with the <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@44 = ~<CHARNAME>, has anyone told you that you don't have the kindest appearance?~
@45 = ~It's not a bad thing by any standards. Well, maybe except for him.~
@46 = ~Who knew gnolls were polite?~
@47 = ~Should've picked up your wages as soon as possible.~
@48 = ~Possessions change a man, usually for the worse.~
@49 = ~Damn, almost had them.~
@50 = ~I think foolish bravery is the right word for it.~
@51 = ~Silence!~
@52 = ~Playing in an abandoned lighthouse without supervision? What a scoundrel.~
@53 = ~This is not a joke, and there is no time to waste! Please, you must help him!~
@54 = ~Isn't that the quote of the day? Don't ask questions. Just do it.~
@55 = ~Gold can cure everything nowadays.~
@56 = ~Cads and bounders, that's a new one for me.~
@57 = ~Can't turn down the money, right?~
@58 = ~I can't say I like making children cry, but I never liked being the bearer of bad news either.~
@59 = ~Hope. The epitome of why we never stop believing.~
@60 = ~It speaks, and I can understand it!~
@61 = ~Shut up, puny human!~
@62 = ~You are the biggest pest, <CHARNAME>. Let the man sing.~
@63 = ~Let's not get arrested or attacked by the Flaming Fist, <CHARNAME>. At least, not today, but some other day.~
@64 = ~The government tries to do good things for its citizens, but I've always hated that it hangs in the balance of one person.~
@65 = ~Ah shit, I can't imagine being cramped in one place for so long.~
@66 = ~Aren't you supposed to be the expert in staying at one place for a long time, seeing as how you've been on a ship for the majority of your life?~
@67 = ~This isn't a good time to interject right now, Zakrion. Are you okay?~
@68 = ~I don't have time for this. Let's go.~
@69 = ~Yeah, sure, I understand what you're saying, but a ship is big. I meant being trapped in a small, cramped place with no room to breathe.~
@70 = ~That's my worst fear.~
@71 = ~Decent, hardworking folk? Says the man who is sitting here and drinking himself to death.~
@72 = ~Let's not bother the cook, <CHARNAME>. They have a very important job to do.~
@73 = ~I sincerely hope he doesn't spit on the food...~
@74 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>. If we keep bothering the cooks, then they'll take longer to serve to the Duke, and we'll be the last ones to eat.~
@75 = ~This isn't a good time to bother the cooks. They'll take longer to serve to the Duke, and we'll be the last ones to eat, <CHARNAME>..~
@76 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you smell that delicious armoa? My mouth is already watering.~
@77 = ~Get out of here, you dogs!~
@78 = ~But, even dogs get scraps.~
@79 = ~Out, out, out!~
@80 = ~Children embody innocence. They may not have the best attitude or know what's best, but they're the only true innocence we have on this plane. Only a true monster would take away this.~
@81 = ~<CHARNAME>, halflings are wonderful people, and I have no wish to partake in any violents thoughts you may be having.~
@82 = ~The salbread! Where can I find the salbread?~
@83 = ~Ah, my friend! Is that not the question of the day for us all?~
@84 = ~You already know me better than most. I'll have to pay another visit to this place in the near future.~
@85 = ~We would welcome you with open arms if you decided to do so!~
@86 = ~So, traveler, how can Gandolar Luckyfoor be at your disposal?~
@87 = ~We'll gladly help, right, <CHARNAME>?~
@88 = ~<CHARNAME>, halflings are wonderful people, and I have no wish to partake in any violents thoughts you may be having.~
@89 = ~Thank the gods. No, thank you, <CHARNAME>!~ 
@90 = ~I didn't think I'd see a tavern for a long while, and now that I'm in one again, I never want to leave it. You are a miracle worker.~
@91 = ~No problem, enjoy your rest.~
@92 = ~I've never been called that before, but you're welcome.~
@93 = ~Any time, bye now.~
@94 = ~You're welcome. Now, get out of my sight, and take a shower while you're at it. You smell horrific.~
@95 = ~You don't need to tell me that twice.~
@96 = ~Thanks for showing me the way. I don't think either of us wants to see each other again.~
@97 = ~Wait!~
@98 = ~What now?~
@99 = ~Do you need something else?~
@100 = ~Huh?~
@101 = ~Nope, that's it. I brought you to a tavern, and that's all. Go away.~
@102 = ~Sure, sure, but I'd like to say something first.~
@103 = ~I can hold myself in a battle well enough; you saw that on our travels here.~
@104 = ~As I said before though, I don't have a ship nor a crew.~
@105 = ~Would you be open to allowing me to join your crew? I think I could gather some coin along the way and, with Tymora's luck, I'll be able to find another ship.~
@106 = ~I don't see why not. Welcome aboard!~
@107 = ~Sure, we could always use another hand.~
@108 = ~Sorry, but we don't need another person.~
@109 = ~You are pretty useless in battle. I need someone more formidable. Bye, now.~
@110 = ~Sure, that's fine.~
@111 = ~I'll be languishing in this tavern to the end of my days, feasting upon the porridge and pints of ale.~
@112 = ~I'm only kidding, after this rest, you won't see me in here again.~
@113 = ~Fantastic news! I'll be ready to travel as soon as I'm up.~
@114 = ~Now, I need to find a bed...~
@115 = ~<CHARNAME>, you said you'd take me to a tavern, and I expected to be taken to a tavern by now.~
@116 = ~Yes, we're going straight to one right now.~
@117 = ~Hold on, we're doing a few things first before I take you to one.~
@118 = ~Change of plans, we aren't taking you to a tavern anymore.~ 
@119 = ~Did you really think I was going to drop everything just to help you? Think again.~
@120 = ~I wish you would've told me that sooner. I wouldn't have wasted my energy on this.~ 
@121 = ~I'll find my own way to one, thanks for nothing, <CHARNAME>.~
@122 = ~Sure, sure, but I'm really tired. Hopefully, we'll be at a tavern soon.~
@123 = ~That would be great, thanks.~
@124 = ~Okay, <CHARNAME>. I can see that you're not a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of your words, so I'm going to take my leave now, and try to find the tavern on my own.~
@125 = ~Thanks for nothing.~
@126 = ~<CHARNAME>. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner? Go.~
@127 = ~What are you talking about?~
@128 = ~Someone's hungry.~ 
@129 = ~What is this nonsense?~
@130 = ~No, I'm not hungry, but I wouldn't say no to a meal.~
@131 = ~And I certainly would not say no to a free one - a meal is always better when it's free, but that's not the point.~
@132 = ~It's an icebreaker.~
@133 = ~I use it whenever there is fresh meat aboard the ship.~
@134 = ~It's a good way to start a harmless conversation, and it's interesting to see how the person reacts.~
@135 = ~It's almost similar to tossing an apple at an unexpecting stranger. Do they catch it? Bat at it? Or possibly screech because they were caught off guard?~
@136 = ~I know what an icebreaker is, but I don't think that's a very good comparison.~
@137 = ~Oh, well, when you put it like that. I think I understand.~
@138 = ~You could've just asked me a normal question like a normal person.~
@139 = ~In that case, I prefer breakfast.~
@140 = ~In that case, I prefer lunch.~
@141 = ~In that case, I prefer dinner.~
@142 = ~No worries. We'll pick this up another time, but maybe not with your favorite meal time.~
@143 = ~Glad you learned something new, and we are entitled to our own opinions.~
@144 = ~Glad you learned something new.~
@145 = ~But, where is the fun in being normal?~
@146 = ~It's the stranger things that make the world a more interesting and less predictable place.~
@147 = ~Now, back to my original question. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner?~
@148 = ~I prefer breakfast.~
@149 = ~I prefer lunch.~
@150 = ~I prefer dinner.~
@151 = ~This is a waste of my time. I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@152 = ~Breakfast?~
@153 = ~You must be an early riser. Early bird always gets the worm, good on you.~
@154 = ~Or, maybe you just like breakfast food.~
@155 = ~I've always been a fan of lunch. It's when I get to eat till my heart is content, and I don't feel too bad about it because there's still daylight to burn away what I've eaten.~
@156 = ~Lunch?~
@157 = ~I have to say that must be my favorite meal of the day, too.~
@158 = ~It's when I get to eat till my heart is content, and I don't feel too bad about it because there's still daylight to burn away what I've eaten.~
@159 = ~Dinner?~
@160 = ~Or, maybe you just like dinner food.~
@161 = ~I've always been a fan of lunch. It's when I get to eat till my heart is content, and I don't feel too bad about it because there's still daylight to burn away what I've eaten.~
@162 = ~To that end, I only know how to cook three meals: one for breakfast, one for lunch, and one for dinner.~
@163 = ~Surprising, right? You'd think a glutton like me would know every recipe under the sun - I'd be a bonafide chef if I did know it all! Heh, but as life would have it, I am at your side asking you about your favorite meal time.~
@164 = ~Do you see what I mean now? Not only are icebreakers meant to break the ice between us, but we learned more about each other and, hopefully, we feel a tad more comfortable around each other than we did before.~
@165 = ~Plus, now you know not to make me in charge of the cooking, unless you want the same meal over and over again.~
@166 = ~Now that the ice has been broken, we can have all hands aboard.~
@167 = ~We aren't on a ship nor are we sailors.~
@168 = ~I think you might have to lose your ship lingo.~
@169 = ~Alright, what do you want to talk about?~
@170 = ~The ice might have been broken, but it doesn't allow you to speak when not spoken to. Fall back in line.~
@171 = ~Right. I forgot I'm not the captain anymore.~
@172 = ~Lead the way, captain. Consider my lips sealed and the key thrown away from here on out.~
@173 = ~Right. I forget about that sometimes, and I suppose I can't be a sailor without a ship.~
@174 = ~It's hard to break old habits, and, besides, I don't plan on being off a ship for too long. My stay on land is temporary, very temporary.~
@175 = ~Anyhow, I wanted to talk to you about my ship.~
@176 = ~How I crashed my ship.~
@177 = ~Let me rephrase that, I didn't crash my ship intentionally. Well, I didn't want to destory it, just scrape it a little.~
@178 = ~Ah, let me start over.~
@179 = ~My crew and I were setting sail to the City of Coin, Athkatla. Everything was going well; the winds were on our side, and the boys were shivering with excitement for our voyage.~
@180 = ~I hadn't seen them so excited since... well, nevermind.~
@181 = ~We both know Lady Luck can be fickle, and my luck ran out when my ship was spotted by another - a pirate ship.~
@182 = ~What did you do?~
@183 = ~Go on.~
@184 = ~Are you going to get to the point already?~ 
@185 = ~Alright, that's enough chit-chat. Get back in line, and keep quiet.~
@186 = ~I'm getting to it.~
@187 = ~As I was saying...~
@188 = ~I thought I could navigate away from it, and I would have succeeded if there was only one of them.~
@189 = ~However, just when my luck couldn't get any better, more pirate ships appeared and were heading in our direction. I knew I could outmaneuver them all with little difficulty.~
@190 = ~I also had accounted for the surprise attack, because a captain should always expect the unexpected, but I had forgotten about the dangers beneath the waves. We would've gotten away, and we were damn well close to escaping if it wasn't for the erratic waves and shit landscape.~
@191 = ~Anyhow, to make a long story short, I made a miscalculation that cost my crew and I our vessel... and their lives.~
@192 = ~Well, that was an unexpectingly sad tale to recount. It sounded more impressive and noble in my head. Maybe I should say it aloud to myself first than using you as the guinea pig.~
@193 = ~Our previous conversation might have been too much, especially since we haven't been traveling with each other for too long.~
@194 = ~I didn't think our conversation would become as intense as it was.~
@195 = ~Yeah, that was a little too intense for me.~
@196 = ~It's no worries. Some topics aren't meant to be light.~
@197 = ~Why did you have to tell me that sad story anyway?~
@198 = ~Let's talk about a happier topic, shall we?~
@199 = ~Not this again.~
@200 = ~Sure, sure. I get it.~
@201 = ~I'll take note of that right away, captain.~
@202 = ~Yeah, I get that.~
@203 = ~I wasn't intending it to be sad, depressing, horrible, whatever you want to describe it as.~
@204 = ~But, yeah, I get that it would come off as sad. I just want to let you know that I don't plan on making every serious story I tell you sad.~
@205 = ~You read my mind.~
@206 = ~Who should start, you or me?~
@207 = ~You go ahead.~
@208 = ~I'll start. What do you want to know?~
@209 = ~I don't want to speak, and I especially don't want you to say anything.~ 
@210 = ~Anyway, I wanted this conversation to be heartwarming and jolly. A time for us to to share some light, fun stories about ourselves.~
@211 = ~Another icebreaker?~
@212 = ~Alright. You start first.~
@213 = ~Okay, what do you want to know about me?~
@214 = ~Haha, no, not another icebreaker. Although, that's not a bad idea.~
@215 = ~Okay, I'll start. What do you want to know?~
@216 = ~Alright, you go ahead, and start talking.~
@217 = ~I don't want to speak, and I especially don't want you to say anything else.~
@218 = ~If you insist.~
@219 = ~Hm, there's so many places to begin... Ah, got one.~
@220 = ~When I was a little boy, I was incredibly chubby. That was most likely the result of my voracious appetite, and I blame that completely on the salbread...~
@221 = ~Really? That's what you wanted to tell me?~
@222 = ~What's salbread?~
@223 = ~Ha! I can definitely see you as a chubby boy!~
@224 = ~I find that hard to believe, given your physique now.~
@225 = ~And?~
@226 = ~Oh, I love salbread!~
@227 = ~I said I would make the topic lighter again, didn't I?~
@228 = ~You've never heard of salbread? That must be one of the most depressing things I've ever heard.~
@229 = ~Salbread originated from the wonderful halflings of Luiren. It's popular among sailors since it can last for many weeks before spoiling.~
@230 = ~My favorite type of salbread are the ones with orange peels, but the ones with lemon peels are good too. I would definitely try both if you were ever presented with the opportunity.~
@231 = ~I'm not sure how to respond to that, but, yeah, I could see myself as a big kid too. I was one.~
@232 = ~Well, that's very nice of you to say that. I wish I could say that I lost all my weight from sailing, but growing into a man somehow caused me to lose weight. Although, I did have to work for the muscles I have now.~
@233 = ~Ah! So, you must understand how glorious it is. The salbread with the orange peels is my favorite, but I won't discriminate against the ones with lemon peels.~
@234 = ~I've heard the name "Gorion" a few times since we started traveling.~
@235 = ~Was he your father?~
@236 = ~No, Gorion wasn't my father, but he was the closest thing to a father I had.~
@237 = ~Gorion was as a good man, but he wasn't my father.~
@238 = ~He cared for me - that is all.~
@239 = ~My father? Gods, no. I am so happy I'm not related to that old fool.~
@240 = ~Now, it's your turn.~
@241 = ~He sounds like a good, caring man from the way you speak about him.~
@242 = ~There needs to be more people like him in the world.~
@243 = ~If you don't think it's too bold for me to say, I think you meant a lot to him.~
@244 = ~He doesn't sound like a bad man to me, if he gave up his life to protect you.~
@245 = ~Yet, I know there are always two sides of a coin so I must be missing something.~
@246 = ~Shit, I've done it again, haven't I?~
@247 = ~I promised that this wouldn't be too serious, and here I am talking about your dead foster father!~
@248 = ~The pain of his loss is probably fresh in your mind, too; I'm sorry for bringing this up. I'll stop talking now.~
@249 = ~I realized I might have touched a sore spot when we last spoke.~
@250 = ~I know when my father died I hated everything that reminded me of him.~
@251 = ~I am sorry to hear that your father passed.~
@252 = ~It's no worries at all, really. With every new day, I feel a little better.~
@253 = ~It's really hard for me to think about, and I'm still trying to get over it.~
@254 = ~It was very inconsiderate of you to bring it up.~
@255 = ~I don't really care; he's dead and going to stay dead.~
@256 = ~You're taking it much better than I did when I was in your place.~
@257 = ~I understand that. Please, take all the time you need.~
@258 = ~Yeah, I get that. Sometimes, words just pop out of my mouth before I can think to say them.~
@259 = ~I won't deny that he will stay dead unless a scroll of resurrection will work on him, but something tells me it's too late for that.~
@260 = ~And I'm sorry to hear your Gorion no longer breathes the same air we do.~
@261 = ~I can't bring him back to life for you, but I can try to ease your suffering. This may sound very strange, terrible even, but people bond through their suffering. That's how we can connect, and what's the best way to get out someone's emotions?~
@262 = ~Once again, the answer is through suffering.~
@263 = ~So, would you mind if I told you about a time I suffered?~
@264 = ~I suppose.~
@265 = ~Sure, let's have a pity fest at the end of it.~
@266 = ~It's always fun hearing someone suffer, go for it!~
@267 = ~What happened to all the joyful topics you had up your sleeve?~
@268 = ~No, I don't want to hear about any more suffering.~
@269 = ~I don't care to hear about anymore of your blabbering. Just shut up already.~
@270 = ~Plans change all the time. Nothing goes according to plan anyway when you're on a ship or traveling with you.~
@271 = ~Who does, except for the damned and the wicked?~
@272 = ~But, I hear speaking about your suffering or hearing about it from others may help to relieve some of the pain and frustration built up within you.~
@273 = ~Yes, captain. Of course.~
@274 = ~I'll start with my father.~
@275 = ~He was a good man, just like your Gorion, but he wasn't a great sage. He was just my father - a simple fisherman.~
@276 = ~My father lived a hard life, but he always made sure I was well fed. I remember I always had three meals a day, my mother had two, and my father would have one... unless he hid that from me too.~
@277 = ~He was an honest, hardworking man. He would be away from home on a fishing trip for many days, sometimes even weeks. I hated when he left my mother and me; she would mope around, and I would stare out from the window into the never-ending sea.~
@278 = ~My mother would go into a deep sadness when my father would leave and, during these bouts, she would clean and clean and clean. Everything had to be spotless, and, if I ever tracked a single spot of dirt into our home, she'd scrub me until my skin turned red.~
@279 = ~It must have been hard as a child to go through that.~
@280 = ~I don't know what to say to that.~
@281 = ~Is that the suffering you were talking about?~
@282 = ~That explains why you always seem obsessed with being clean.~
@283 = ~Blah, blah, get to the point already.~
@284 = ~I think it was hard for twelve-year-old me, but it's made me who I am today. The ends justify the means.~
@285 = ~Don't feel sorry for me, <CHARNAME>. There are other people in more difficult situations than I was in at that time.~
@286 = ~Sometimes, saying nothing is worth more than saying something.~
@287 = ~Some suffering, but not the meat of it.~
@288 = ~You've found out my secret! Yes, I can't stand it when there's a splotch of dirt on my boots, and there's a stain on my hand.~
@289 = ~And, yes, I know it's ironic seeing as how I am an ex-sailor, and we weren't known to have the best hygiene.~
@290 = ~My father may have been gone the majority of my childhood, but that's not to say I didn't have any good times.~
@291 = ~When my father came back home, my mother would be the most delightful woman in the world, and our little family would be the epitome of a happy family. She would even teach me how to read and write.~
@292 = ~"Zakrion! You will speak as eloquently as possible. You will NOT be bundled up with the common rabble!" That was Mrs. Dessani. She is... was a wonderful woman, I promise.~
@293 = ~You see, my mother was a well-educated woman who came from a fairly wealthy family. Truthfully, I don't know how she met my father and why she married him. The obvious answer is that she loved him, but I know deep down she thought she deserved more.~
@294 = ~I suppose my mother had enough of feeling so morose for the majority of the seasons. I remember on one particular fishing trip, my father was gone for an abnormally long amount of time.~
@295 = ~When he finally arrived home, my mother... she, well, couldn't take it anymore. She screamed relentlessly at him for who knows how long and left us both the next morning without a word.~
@296 = ~I didn't see that coming, and I don't think my father saw that coming either.~
@297 = ~After all these years, you'd think I'd be over it by now, but thinking and speaking of her departure still touches a nerve.~
@298 = ~I think that's enough for one sitting. We'll continue this another time; I can't get too distracted by the past after all.~
@299 = ~So, <CHARNAME>, is it a good time to ask what your childhood was like?~
@300 = ~Ask away.~
@301 = ~Sure, let's talk about my childhood.~
@302 = ~I really don't want to talk about my childhood with you.~
@303 = ~No, it's a terrible time to ask me that now.~
@304 = ~No, and you're not allowed to ask me any more questions from here on out.~
@305 = ~So, no more questions from the captain? Can't say I appreciate that, but you're the captain of this motley crew so what you say goes.~
@306 = ~That's fair. I won't push the subject.~
@307 = ~Although, I hope one day you'd like to share it with me.~
@308 = ~So, when would be the best time for you? I'd like to ask you about it now.~
@309 = ~Alright, fine. Let's talk about it now.~
@310 = ~I don't want to talk about my childhood.~
@311 = ~Never.~
@312 = ~Great. So, back to my original question: what was your childhood like?~
@313 = ~I absolutely loved my childhood. It could not have been better.~
@314 = ~It was good; I had plenty of happy moments.~ 
@315 = ~It was great. I had all the books in the world to read, and each book was a new adventure for me to join.~
@316 = ~It was okay; there's nothing much to talk about.~
@317 = ~It was so boring. I never cared for the books and old scholars there. Nothing interesting ever seemed to happen.~
@318 = ~It was a little dull at times, but I had some great memories.~
@319 = ~I didn't like it. Nothing really stood out to me as a good memory.~
@320 = ~Terrible. Just terrible. I hated it all of it.~
@321 = ~I don't like thinking about my childhood. There's nothing much to reminisce.~
@322 = ~I mean it when I say that is wonderful to hear. There are so many terrible things in the world, it's just good to hear something... good.~
@323 = ~There's always something interesting to tell. It may not be as interesting to you, but maybe to someone like me.~
@324 = ~Although, I am glad nothing terrible happened to you.~
@325 = ~Growing up in Candlekeep was boring? I can't imagine.~
@326 = ~Heh, I was never the one to stick my head in a book, unless I was forced to.~
@327 = ~Life isn't always a fun adventure, but, when it's good, you remember it for a lifetime.~
@328 = ~It is nice to hear that nothing terrible happened to you.~
@329 = ~I am sorry to hear that. We may not be able to change the past, but we can always create good memories now.~
@330 = ~Children need to keep their innocence and enjoy life while they can. Many people forget that.~
@331 = ~I understand the need to ensure that they are molded into decent beings, but society gets so lost in what is the norm or what is expected of them. I think that many children lose their childhood.~
@332 = ~I'd like to say that halflings are a wonderful mix of hard-working and fun-loving individuals. They never lose their child-like attitude towards the world. Everyday is a true adventure to them.~
@333 = ~Yet, look at us now. Everyday is an adventure for us, whether we like it or not.~
@334 = ~I've done a lot of thinking, and I think I'm ready as I'll ever be to get on with round two of my struggles.~
@335 = ~Would you like for me to continue?~
@336 = ~Go ahead.~
@337 = ~I don't see why not.~
@338 = ~I don't want to hear anymore about your struggles.~
@339 = ~Nope. I'd like you to stop.~
@340 = ~Alright, I guess I can't say no to that, can I, captain?~
@341 = ~I didn't think so.~
@342 = ~I can't say I blame you.~
@343 = ~Sure thing.~
@344 = ~Do you remember what happened to my father? To me? My mother left both of us after my dad returned from his extended fishing trip, and I haven't seen her since.~
@345 = ~My father didn't take it very well as you can imagine. However, at my age, I had never seen my dad express any emotions except happiness. You can only imagine how I reacted when I saw him trash our home and drink ale every day for months.~
@346 = ~I don't know what snapped in him on one particular day, but he stopped shutting himself away from the world and began to be more involved with the local tavern.~
@347 = ~I know what you're thinking. He's probably there to drink more; your father is a drunkard. He might have been one, I don't know but if he was, he was damn good at hiding it.~
@348 = ~After his frequent visitations to the tavern, which happened for a couple months or so, he told me to pack up our bags because we'd never set foot in the house again.~
@349 = ~And that's how he became a sailor - and how I became a sailor, too.~
@350 = ~So, you two just boarded a ship and called yourselves sailors?~
@351 = ~That doesn't seem like much of a struggle to me.~
@352 = ~Oh, that must have been nice, I suppose.~
@353 = ~What made your father do that?~
@354 = ~That was the stupidest story I've heard all day.~
@355 = ~If only it were that easy.~
@356 = ~There was some form of... initiation. I think that's the best word to describe it. That was only the first part of it though.~
@357 = ~Maybe not this part of my story, no, but I didn't want to talk about how I cried and hid inside a closet during those months my father went into his form of hibernation.~
@358 = ~That's not a part of good story-telling anyway.~
@359 = ~It was nice to leave the house, yes, but still sad to leave it, especially when you get attached to it.~
@360 = ~Like I said, I have no idea what snapped in him one day.~
@361 = ~I've heard stupider stories, but, if mine was the stupidest one of the day, I'd consider that an achievement for me.~
@362 = ~I'll admit. This second part of my story wasn't the most exciting part, but I always find it strange, almost fascinating, that people can change so quickly.~
@363 = ~Or, maybe my father was changing the whole time, and I just wasn't looking hard enough.~
@364 = ~<CHARNAME>, how does it feel doing the same thing over and over again and knowing that repetition is the only way you're ever going to make it out alive?~
@365 = ~What are you referring to?~
@366 = ~How is what we're doing a repetition?~
@367 = ~I have no idea what you're talking about.~
@368 = ~Please stop asking me these senseless questions.~
@369 = ~Here I thought you were getting used to the sound of my voice.~
@370 = ~Very well, you'll hear no more from me, captain.~
@371 = ~This. What we are doing now. Every time you put one foot in front of the other, every time you sense that monsters are nearby, every slash, every ball of magic, it's just fighting and killing all over again.~
@372 = ~How does it feel knowing that this is the only thing that can keep you alive - the only thing that lets you make progress on your quests?~
@373 = ~It seems like all of this has been laid out for you, and you're just following someone else's plan.~
@374 =  ~In order to see this plan into fruition, you must do the same cycle everyday. Don't get me wrong, you're do some exciting things, but, some days, we're just walking and walking. Then, we sleep, eat, maybe talk to a merchant or two, just to go back to walking.~
@375 = ~Are you seriously complaining about walking? Unfortunately for us, we don't have horse-drawn carriages to take us everywhere.~ 
@376 = ~There's nothing boring about what we do; we could die at any moment for crying out loud!~
@377 = ~I still don't understand what you're trying to get at.~
@378 = ~Ever since I left Candlekeep, everyday has become more and more unpredictable. There is no repetition.~
@379 = ~I don't view this as "repetition"; it's just something we have to do in our to finish what we do.~
@380 = ~I'm not complaining about walking, although horse-drawn carriages would be nice. A land ship would be better though.~
@381 = ~It isn't boring, you're right. I meant to say that the process is repetitive.~
@382 = ~It's the process of completing your quests, our quests.~
@383 = ~You're right. You've only started adventuring some weeks ago? You're entirely new to this, especially since you grew up at Candlekeep.~
@384 = ~Yes, this is what we have to do. I won't dispute that, but it's the process of doing it.~
@385 = ~I'm probably not the best person to discuss this, hell, I know I am not the best person to say this, but don't you ever wonder what would happen if you stopped?~
@386 = ~No, I wouldn't stop.~
@387 = ~Stop and be killed by people who are trying to kill me!?~
@388 = ~I don't want to stop; I want and must do this.~
@389 = ~I thought about stopping and leaving this all behind, but it isn't feasible.~
@390 = ~Stopped what?~
@391 = ~Are you that stupid? We can't stop now.~
@392 = ~Why?~
@393 = ~I find what I do exciting, and I don't want to do anything else.~
@394 = ~I will stop when I feel that I am safe.~
@395 = ~There is something after me, and I feel like even if I "stopped", my pursuer would still come after me.~
@396 = ~I don't want to talk to you about this anymore.~
@397 = ~My reasons are my own.~
@398 = ~Then, I won't pursue it, but...~
@399 = ~Fair enough, but...~
@400 = ~You have a point, but... ~
@401 = ~Stopped this quest of yours. Stopped and started a new, different life.~
@402 = ~No, I wouldn't stop.~ 
@403 = ~Stop and be killed by people who are trying to kill me!?~ 
@404 = ~I don't want to stop; I want and must do this.~
@405 = ~I thought about stopping and leaving this all behind, but it isn't feasible.~
@406 = ~Are you that stupid? We can't stop now.~
@407 = ~Stupid? I've been described as that before, but why can't you stop now?~
@408 = ~Nevermind. Forget what I said, I'm starting to get confused at what I was trying to get at.~
@409 = ~You know, <CHARNAME>, my mother once owned the largest, fattest, orange cat I've ever seen.~
@410 = ~What has that got to do with anything?~
@411 = ~Okay...?~
@412 = ~I don't believe you. Prove it.~
@413 = ~What did your mother feed the cat?~
@414 = ~I love cats!~
@415 = ~What? How am I supposed to do that? Resurrect him by gathering all his ashes into a small urn and bringing it to a priest?~
@416 = ~I don't think it works like that, but I'd love to be proven wrong. I think seeing an undead cat would be an exciting day for me.~
@417 = ~Only the gods know what that woman fed to the cat. Although, I remember eating mushrooms, and he pounced on top of and stole one of my mushrooms, and ran off with it.~
@418 = ~So, I guess he ate everything he could get his claws on.~
@419 = ~Good creatures, they are. Wonderful mouse hunters, and, if the cat is nice enough to allow you to sleep on their belly, they make good pillows.~
@420 = ~I didn't really have a purpose coming into this conversation. I just thought I could disrupt this gloomy ride with something out of the ordinary.~
@421 = ~Gloomy ride? I haven't been gloomy these past few days.~
@422 = ~Heh, thanks. It's nice to hear something random once in a while.~
@423 = ~Me? Gloomy? Never!~
@424 = ~The only gloomy person on this team is that elf over there.~
@425 = ~Well, I don't appreciate you bringing up random things just to talk.~
@426 = ~Maybe it's only me, then.~
@427 = ~Glad to see a smile on your face.~
@428 = ~You could've had me fooled!~
@429 = ~... I don't think I could ever cheer up that fellow, even if I tried my hardest.~
@430 = ~I'll take note of that in the future, but I make no promises.~
@431 = ~When I was the captain of my own crew, there would be days where the men would be so bored that they contemplated jumping overboard in order to save what was left of their sanity.~
@432 = ~The ocean is beautiful and majestic, but, for those who prefer the land to the sea and have seen it one day too many, they look like they have lost hope when they look at the never-ending blue.~
@433 = ~I thought that maybe you might have felt that way too when all we see is green. I thought I'd break that thought of jumping overboard, if you were thinking of doing that.~
@434 = ~Although, you wouldn't be able to jump overboard without a ship or a boat, so we can consider this friendly banter, from one friend to another.~
@435 = ~I'm surprised at how natural you are at adventuring, <CHARNAME>. I used to be so seasick whenever I was on a boat.~ 
@436 = ~Seasick on a boat? You're a sailor.~
@437 = ~It comes naturally.~
@438 = ~Thanks, I really like adventuring, and I think I am good at it, too.~
@439 = ~You think so?~
@440 = ~I have my doubts about that.~
@441 = ~I'm better than you, that's why.~
@442 = ~You forget, I was once a fat boy who couldn't even run around the block without wheezing heavily.~
@443 = ~It really does.~
@444 = ~You are quite good at it.~
@445 = ~I know so, at least I think so.~
@446 = ~Take it from me, you really seem to be a natural at it.~
@447 = ~Sure, sure. I'll let you think that.~
@448 = ~Really. I'm quite envious of your achievements thus far. It took me years to be able to look at the sea without turning green.~
@449 = ~I remember the time where I first set foot on a boat... it seems so long ago.~
@450 = ~You speak as if you've lived centuries.~
@451 = ~How old are you, Zakrion?~
@452 = ~You really were a pansy. You still are one, too.~
@453 = ~It's taking me a lot of restraint to not poke you with my weapon. Stop taunting me.~
@454 = ~Pansy, pansy, Zakrion is a pansy!~
@455 = ~Fine, you're no fun.~
@456 = ~Whatever.~
@457 = ~Gods, when you do that, you remind me of a child.~
@458 = ~For the sake of my sanity and for your safety, I'm going to ignore those comments, and ask myself a question.~
@459 = ~"Zakrion, you must be so old - how old are you?"~
@460 = ~Isn't there a saying never to ask a man his age or bring it up?~
@461 = ~I'm only joking, but I really do think there was a saying of some sorts about age... regardless, I've seen twenty-eight winters, and I've been captain for less than five years now.~
@462 = ~You haven't been a ship captain for very long, then.~
@463 = ~That's a young age to lead a crew.~
@464 = ~Being able to lead a crew at such a young age is impressive.~
@465 = ~I've heard more impressive stories.~
@466 = ~Thanks, but look at yourself. You're younger than me, and you're doing far more notable things than I could have ever done.~
@467 = ~I wasn't trying to impress you, <CHARNAME>.~
@468 = ~Me being captain was more accidental than anything. It was only supposed to happen under drastic circumstances.~
@469 = ~I didn't think my father would leave this world until I was in my forties or fifties. Hells, he was healthy as an ox and probably would've lived for a century if not for drastic, unexpected events.~
@470 = ~... I think I get into too serious conversations with you all too often. It's like you're a magnet for me to tell you everything that has went on in my life.~
@471 = ~I'll do us both a favor though by saying we need to continue on the road. There are more important things to attend to other than hearing me spill out more of my life stories.~
@472 = ~I think it would've been nice to have some siblings, preferably older ones so I wouldn't have to be responsible for everything.~
@473 = ~I wouldn't want any siblings, I like being the only child.~
@474 = ~I would want a younger sibling, so I could boss them around.~
@475 = ~I would want a younger sibling: it would be nice to be able to teach someone and watch them grow.~
@476 = ~I would want a younger sibling, but I have no reasoning behind it.~
@477 = ~I would want an older sibling, but for a different reason other than yours.~
@478 = ~I agree with your reasoning: I would want an older sibing, too.~ 
@479 = ~I don't know, I haven't given it much thought.~
@480 = ~I'd be fine with being a middle child, I'd be able to experience both sides of it.~
@481 = ~I don't know why you keep bringing up these pointless questions. Haven't you learned yet that I don't care about them?~
@482 = ~I keep asking because you keep giving me answers to these pointless questions.~ 
@483 = ~I'll stop for the sake of your sanity.~
@484 = ~I get that. Being the only child means you get to be the most favorite... and the least favorite.~
@485 = ~I get that. That is why I was a ship captain, well, partially the reason why.~
@486 = ~I get that. It's rewarding to see someone grow under your wing.~
@487 = ~Fair enough, not everything needs to have a reason.~
@488 = ~Fair enough, we all have different reasonings for the things we want and the things we do.~
@489 = ~Your agreement assures me that my reasoning really is valid!~
@490 = ~Fair enough, I probably had more time to waste than you.~
@491 = ~I didn't think of that, that's a fantastic idea. I could experience leading and commanding, while watching the youngster grow into a beautiful butterfly.~
@492 = ~Beautiful if my younger sibling was a girl and handsome if the youngster was a boy. Now, that just sounds weird...~
@493 = ~I guess I'm bringing this up, because it would've been nice having someone to lean on after my father's death.~
@494 = ~Do you want to talk about it?~
@495 = ~I understand. It's hard when you have to face the hardships alone.~
@496 = ~I can relate to that. You know that I recently lost my foster father...~
@497 = ~All I hear is you whining nowadays. Grow up.~
@498 = ~Yeah, I'd like that.~
@499 = ~Your foster father's death is fresher in your mind. I should be the one comforting you.~
@500 = ~No, it's fine. It's clear that you want to talk about what happened with your father. Do you want to talk about it?~
@501 = ~Yes, you should. You're being very selfish.~
@502 = ~I don't want to talk about losing Gorion anyway. Would you like to talk about your father?~
@503 = ~Hmph. I don't care about Gorion, so there's nothing to talk about.~
@504 = ~It's fine, but I'd like to talk about Gorion - how I feel about losing him.~
@505 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. Tell me how you feel about losing Gorion.~
@506 = ~I feel... so lost. I feel like I'm in a nightmare, and I can't wake myself up.~
@507 = ~I don't even know where to begin, Zakrion. I'm just so glad I have friends like you that have my back.~
@508 = ~I don't even know where to begin, Zakrion. I'm just so glad to have you by my side. I find your presence... comforting to me.~
@509 = ~I feel so free. I don't have someone constantly looking over my shoulder.~
@510 = ~Some days, I feel fine, but, on other days, I remember he's dead, and I feel guilty.~
@511 = ~For what it's worth, you have friends standing with you. You are not alone in your battles, and, if you're lost, then as the captain of this crew, we're all lost with you.~
@512 = ~Feel confident, <CHARNAME>, and be confident. Then, all you'll ever feel is confidence.~
@513 = ~Sure, sure. That's what I'm here for.~
@514 = ~I hope you know that, if you should ever need someone to speak to, I am here for you.~
@515 = ~Thanks, Zakrion. Would you like to talk about your father passing?~
@516 = ~I'm going to make myself clear, I don't need you.~
@517 = ~I know you don't. You are a strong <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but you are still a person.~
@518 = ~Just remember, you are not alone, and that's all I ask.~
@519 = ~Thanks, Zakrion. Would you like to talk about your father passing?~
@520 = ~Great. Now, there must have been some point to this conversation. Do you want to talk about your father dying?~
@521 = ~I can understand why you feel that way. It can be overwhelming to find that you have all this freedom when you barely had any before.~
@522 = ~I don't think I felt that when my father died, but, sure, I get it.~
@523 = ~I know I feel guilty too when I think of my father, so I am hypocrite for saying this, but don't feel that way.~
@524 = ~I am sure Gorion wouldn't have wanted you to feel so badly.~
@525 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I find your presence comforting to me as well.~
@526 = ~You know... I was hoping I could confide in you about the death of my father.~
@527 = ~Fine. Go ahead, but make it quick.~
@528 = ~I don't care to listen to what you have to say.~ 
@529 = ~Sure, go ahead.~
@530 = ~I find that hard to believe, but I won't push you any further with it.~
@531 = ~No, it's fine. It's clear that you want to talk about what happened with your father. Do you want to talk about it?~
@532 = ~Wait, I do want to talk about losing Gorion.~
@533 = ~Great. Let's get going, then.~
@534 = ~I was hoping I could confide in you about the loss of my father.~
@535 = ~Fine. Go ahead, but make it quick.~
@536 = ~I don't care to listen to what you have to say.~ 
@537 = ~Sure, go ahead.~
@538 = ~Alright. I'll keep it to myself, then.~
@539 = ~I'll keep it all to myself in the future. You won't have to worry about me opening my mouth anymore for any personal issues of mine.~
@540 = ~Yes, please do. Tell me how you feel about losing Gorion.~
@541 = ~I feel... so lost. I feel like I'm in a nightmare, and I can't wake myself up.~
@542 = ~I don't even know where to begin, Zakrion. I'm just so glad I have friends like you that have my back.~
@543 = ~I don't even know where to begin, Zakrion. I'm just so glad to have you by my side. I find your presence... comforting to me.~
@544 = ~I feel so free. I don't have someone constantly looking over my shoulder.~
@545 = ~Some days, I feel fine, but, on other days, I remember he's dead and I feel guilty.~
@546 = ~I'll admit, I whined a lot when I was a child, but losing your mother and being tossed onto a ship with a group of drunkards and bastards really helps with growing up fast.~
@547 = ~If there is one thing I am sure of, it's that I don't need any more "growing up". All I want now is to find a good tavern and sink into a nice chair by the fireplace with a pint of ale. That's all I'm asking for right now, but I am trudging along following you.~
@548 = ~Then, leave. No one is stopping you, I certainly won't.~
@549 = ~I'm sorry, I'm just not in the best of moods right now.~
@550 = ~Honestly, sitting by a fireplace with a mug of ale sounds like a good idea.~ 
@551 = ~Fine. You had to grow up, but you're not the only one here.~
@552 = ~Done.~
@553 = ~Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. Good luck on your travels.~
@554 = ~That's fine, I know we all have to let it out on some point. I just happened to be the guy who got the short end of the straw.~
@555 = ~Why don't we stop by one at some point and kick up our feet?~
@556 = ~Yes, I know.~
@557 = ~Would it help if you talked about Gorion's passing and how it made you feel? I think it could be beneficial to you.~
@558 = ~No, it's fine. It's clear that you want to talk about what happened with your father. Do you want to talk about it?~
@559 = ~I don't want to talk about losing Gorion. Would you like to talk about your father?~
@560 = ~Hmph. I don't care about Gorion, so there's nothing to talk about.~
@561 = ~It's fine, but I'd like to talk about Gorion - how I feel about losing him.~
@562 = ~Like you, I witnessed my father be murdered in front of my eyes.~
@563 = ~Like you, I ran away, but, not because my father told me to, but because I was and am a coward.~
@564 = ~A pirate captain had gotten a hold of my father and made him walk the plank with a sword at his back. I watched this all from behind a barrel while my father was the heroic one.~
@565 = ~He saw me cowering behind the barrel, and he was able to cause a distraction, which allowed me to flee and untie what little we had left of our crew.~
@566 = ~My father was such a brave man; I can only hope to be half the man he was.~
@567 = ~Even now, I'm scared... terrified of what will happen to me as soon as I set sail. Despite my love for the ocean and all her inhabitants, my fear consumes my love of the sea.~
@568 = ~I never saw you as a coward, and I still don't see you as one now.~ 
@569 = ~You were able to save some of your crew mates. They wouldn't be alive without your bravery.~
@570 = ~That must have been hard telling me that. It's one step closer to having courage in my eyes.~
@571 = ~I'm not impressed with your lack of courage. I hope you don't run away from me when the fight gets tough.~
@572 = ~You are a coward. How could you run away from your own father? You don't deserve to be captain of anything.~
@573 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. I appreciate it, I really do.~
@574 = ~It's nice to hear someone compliment me, but there's always a voice in the back of my head that tells me the opposite.~
@575 = ~It's a bad quality for a leader, I know.~
@576 = ~Yet, they ended up with the same fate as my father.~
@577 = ~I don't plan on running away, <CHARNAME>. It's that fight or flight complex, so I've been told by people smarter than me.~
@578 = ~My first thought is to run when the battle isn't going my way.~
@579 = ~I didn't deserve to be the captain of my father's ship.~
@580 = ~You're right. I don't deserve to be captain of anything.~
@581 = ~I should've been the one to die, not my father. I'm sure the surviving crew mates from the pirate attack would've preferred my father's leadership.~
@582 = ~I tried my best, <CHARNAME>, I really did.~
@583 = ~I'm twenty-eight years old, <CHARNAME>, and I have no idea what to do with my life.~
@584 = ~Are you having a mid-life crisis?~
@585 = ~Is this about our previous conversation about your fear?~
@586 = ~I don't know what to do with my life either; I'm going with the flow.~
@587 = ~That sucks, you should probably get it together.~
@588 = ~Not my problem.~
@589 = ~A mid-life crisis? Do I look fifty years old already to you?~
@590 = ~I know I have blonde in my hair, but I didn't think it looked white, unless I'm standing in the sunshine. I can see where you think it's white-ish, but we're not here to talk about my hair color.~
@591 = ~No. Yes. Partially. Half and half.~
@592 = ~I would've never guessed. You seem to be taking everything with long strides without looking back.~
@593 = ~I envy your confidence.~
@594 = ~Yeah, thanks for the reminder.~
@595 = ~I know it's not, but hear me out.~
@596 = ~I thought about our last talk, and I wanted to say thank you for listening to me.~
@597 = ~You think someone like me would have their life together by now, but no, I'm still muddling through.~
@598 = ~I have to say though - I've been traveling with you for some time, and it's inspiring to watch you on the battlefield. You're a force to be reckoned with, <CHARNAME>.~
@599 = ~Being near you and fighting alongside you has given me some belief in myself.~
@600 = ~I think my next course of action is to find a new ship and find a new crew after our ordeal with the Iron Throne.~
@601 = ~I'm going to find the man who killed my father.~
@602 = ~I've been thinking about this question for the past few days. Maybe you could shed some light on it.~
@603 = ~What would you do with a bad sailor?~
@604 = ~Define bad.~
@605 = ~What are you trying to get out of this?~
@606 = ~I'd throw the sailor overboard. I don't have the time or patience for them.~
@607 = ~I don't know what I would do with the sailor.~
@608 = ~I'd help nurture the sailor. Maybe he'll grow into a fantastic one in the future and all the sailor needed was some guidance.~ 
@609 = ~I'd watch the sailor closely and see if he improves. If the sailor doesn't, then the sailor would need to leave.~
@610 = ~Bad as in the sailor shows up to the deck late. The sailor sleeps on the job and pretends to be the best at everything they put their hands on.~
@611 = ~What are you trying to get out of this?~
@612 = ~I'd throw the sailor overboard. I don't have the time or patience for them.~
@613 = ~I don't know what I would do with the sailor.~
@614 = ~I'd help nurture the sailor. Maybe he'll grow into a fantastic one in the future and all the sailor needed was some guidance.~
@615 = ~I'd watch the sailor closely and see if he improves. If the sailor doesn't, then the sailor would need to leave.~
@616 = ~An answer to my question. So, what would you do?~
@617 = ~I'd throw the sailor overboard. I don't have the time or patience for them.~
@618 = ~I don't know what I would do with the sailor.~
@619 = ~I'd help nurture the sailor.  Maybe he'll grow into a fantastic one in the future and all the sailor needed was some guidance.~ 
@620 = ~I'd watch the sailor closely and see if he improves. If the sailor doesn't, then the sailor would need to leave.~ 
@621 = ~I probably would have done the same. If I am bringing on a new sailor who I believed was competent, the sailor better be competent.~
@622 = ~Otherwise, I've been lied to.~
@623 = ~Really? As a leader, you seem to be very decisive about most of your decisions. I thought a theoretical question would be easier for you to give a final decision.~
@624 = ~You're a better person than I could ever be, I'll tell you that.~
@625 = ~My father would say I'm too harsh in my judgments or decisions, but I think I can justify my reasonings quite well.~
@626 = ~Yet, he always brought me back down from my turmoils by asking me - forcing me to put myself in their shoes and think about why they did the things they did.~
@627 = ~For example, I would automatically come to the conclusion that the sailor deserves to be thrown overboard, but my father would ask himself: why was he late? Why is he saying things to uplift himself? Why the false image?~
@628 = ~It's always been hard for me to stop and ask myself these questions.~
@629 = ~Your father is a wise man.~
@630 = ~I never thought about that before. Thanks for sharing this with me.~
@631 = ~That's a good sentiment, but I don't think I'll be heeding your father's advice.~ 
@632 = ~I think I understand where your father is coming from, but I can't say I agree with you.~
@633 = ~I don't agree with that. Sometimes, people have no reasons for the things they do.~
@634 = ~Yes, he was a very wise man. I like to think he was wiser than the oldest sage, but doesn't every son think their father is the smartest man in the world?~
@635 = ~I wasn't expecting you to take everything you hear to heart. You hear too much every day.~
@636 = ~I wasn't expecting you to agree with me. I'm glad to hear that you don't agree with every little thing you hear.~
@637 = ~I try to remember my father's words while dealing with difficult people, but you're right. Sometimes, people have no reasons for the things they do, and it's difficult to determine the right decision.~
@638 = ~You don't need to thank me. I haven't done anything.~
@639 = ~Thanks for letting me go on about my pointless questions. It's nice to have someone entertaining them.~
@640 = ~Every day is a repeat of the next. Your past is the same and your future is the same. A noteworthy moment is when something out of the norm happens to you.~
@641 = ~It's not fair to anyone, but I don't understand why people don't break free from the shackles of normality. Do you know why, <CHARNAME>?~
@642 = ~Sure, whatever you say, Zakrion.~
@643 = ~I think I need more context in order to give you my opinion.~
@644 = ~I'm unsure of what you're asking me.~
@645 = ~Not this again.~
@646 = ~Stop, just stop. I can't stand your musings or whatever you call them!~
@647 = ~I didn't realize you thought it was so irritating. I would've stopped talking sooner if you had expressed this concern earlier.~
@648 = ~Now, I know better.~
@649 = ~Hear me out.~
@650 = ~I finally had some time to sit down and think about my thoughts carefully.~
@651 = ~You might've remembered our earlier conversation where my thoughts were very jumbled and, quite frankly, I find it rather embarrassing to bring up.~
@652 = ~Anyhow, back to my original train of thought.~
@653 = ~Why is society so content on completing daily activities? We work day in and day out for a few coins in our pockets and, when we fill our pockets with coin, it is immediately taxed and spent on the necessities. Then, we're back to the beginning with very few coins in our pocket.~
@654 = ~It's a cycle, a never-ending cycle, but it is considered the norm. If you don't follow this cycle, you are cast out or considered a person ruining the peace and quiet.~
@655 = ~No one knows that they're shackled, and there's nothing you or I can do about it.~
@656 = ~I agree with you. I feel frustrated that there is nothing we can do about it, but I wished there was a way to show the people that there are other things to life than what they've been dealt.~
@657 = ~Some people don't want things to change, and they're comfortable with the way things are. It's just that simple.~
@658 = ~I don't know why people do what they do, but they must have a reason for it.~
@659 = ~I don't know, I never thought that before.~
@660 = ~Sometimes, there is nothing you can do about it but watch.~
@661 = ~You're giving people too much credit; they're simple creatures with simple minds.~ 
@662 = ~It's nice to hear that someone in the world shares my beliefs and frustrations.~
@663 = ~I don't understand that, and it's not for lack of trying. I've tried to understand this thought process, but I really can't comprehend it.~
@664 = ~Does there have to be a reason for everything?~
@665 = ~I'm glad I could share my opinions with you, then.~
@666 = ~That must be one of the most frustrating things to do. It's almost similar to watching a child stick their finger in the shark-infested ocean and knowing that no matter what you say or do, they won't listen. So, you save your breath and wait for the child to get bitten or killed.~
@667 = ~We are people, <CHARNAME>. Yes, you are extraordinary, but you are still a person.~
@668 = ~I hate to say this, but it seems like we're all sheep, and we're all being herded towards a common goal. No one can stray from the flock or a sheparding dog will come and snap at our legs. If only there was some semblance of balance!~
@669 = ~Sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I can't continue with this conversation right now. I'm too frustrated, and I don't think I'll be able to break free from my frustrations right now or any time soon. I hope you understand.~
@670 = ~I'm sorry about before, <CHARNAME>. I was so angry, so frustrated, I couldn't even think straight for a long while after our talk. I'm still mad thinking about it, but I think I've cooled down enough.~
@671 = ~It's fine, Zakrion. Your anger was justified.~
@672 = ~It's okay. Sometimes, we need to let out our anger from time to time.~
@673 = ~I'm not used to seeing such fury within you. I'd prefer not to see it again if I have to.~
@674 = ~I like angry Zakrion. He's much more confident and terrifying.~
@675 = ~Your apologies don't justify your actions. I don't want to speak to an angry man with problems no one can solve.~
@676 = ~You make a fair point. Although, the problems I have are problems for everyone in a society.~
@677 = ~But yeah, I get that you're done talking about this and talking to me. I'll stay quiet from now on.~
@678 = ~I can't promise I won't get mad, it's a natural thing people to do. If you want someone to not have any sort of emotion, go talk to the shadar-kai. I hear they're filled with absolutely nothing but numbness due to some curse.~
@679 = ~I wasn't expecting to hear that, but thanks?~
@680 = ~Thanks for understanding.~
@681 = ~I think my head is leveled as much as it can be since then, but I think I'm ready to continue. I won't erupt like last time, I can promise that.~
@682 = ~A few good, deep breaths has always done the trick for me. I'll continue if that sounds good to you.~
@683 = ~That's fine, please continue.~
@684 = ~Sure, but don't get so frustrated like last time.~ 
@685 = ~No, not really. I don't care what you have to say.~
@686 = ~No, I don't want to listen to anymore of this, especially knowing that you could have your outburst at any given time.~
@687 = ~That's good to know before I started saying anything or wasting anymore breaths.~
@688 = ~Thanks for listening as far as you did, <CHARNAME>. I think that's worth something.~
@689 = ~Thanks again.~ 
@690 = ~I think the best way for me to describe this is that society has a way of caging the most creative and thought-provoking people.~
@691 = ~You don't know how many times I've seen the same normal people doing the same activities, and then, seeing them receive amazing praise for doing "the norm".~
@692 = ~But, as soon as someone breaks those same activities to pursue something that it's considered what a regular person wouldn't do, society shuns them.~
@693 = ~What happens to those that want to break free from a "normal life"? Society does a damn good job of punishing those that try to break free from its grasp.~
@694 = ~I understand where you're coming from. I've witnessed the same thing.~
@695 = ~You have good insights into this, but I don't know how to comfort you or tell you that it will be different.~
@696 = ~I don't know what you want me to say about this. We can't change what society wants to believe in or do. One person doesn't make a difference.~
@697 = ~I think your insights are invalid: society gives many opportunities to creative people. There are plenty of artisans.~
@698 = ~Your thought process is absurd. Society must be run with "the norm" in mind. How else can they be functional?~ 
@699 = ~Phew, I'm glad my views are valid to someone.~
@700 = ~I don't need you to comfort me. I'm just happy that you think my views are valid.~
@701 = ~I don't need you to say anything. I'm just happy you were willing to listen to what I have to say. Most people dismiss it as wishful thinking or something of the sort.~
@702 = ~I knew you'd say artisans are a prime example of creativity within society, but you fail to mention that they craft to the society's needs - they conform to the people.~
@703 = ~I would say that artisans and the like are the ones that more easily break out of that mold, because, in my experience, they do what they're passionate about.~
@704 = ~I wouldn't consider my thought process absurd, but, then again, I'm biased.~
@705 = ~However, I'd say the quick fix is to ignore money. Money is what drives a society. That's why it is a continuous cycle.~
@706 = ~Money makes men greedy too, and greed can fester in the best of us.~
@707 = ~For me, my version of breaking free from the mold was the ocean. What rules exist in the vast, great blue? I can be free to spread my arms wide, and embrace the winds.~
@708 = ~I'm convinced that no one willingly conforms to society, and, if they do, they haven't tasted true freedom yet. Besides, laws don't balance the world. They only serve those that need the protection. Don't get me wrong, some of us do need protection, but nothing as strict and as binding as laws.~
@709 = ~Thanks again for listening, <CHARNAME>. It was good to get that off my mind, and share it with you.~
@710 = ~You must think I'm a lunatic for even saying this, but what if we got rid of currency altogether? But then again, who doesn't like to be able to buy everything one's heart desires? I certainly wouldn't deny a whole coin purse if it was jingling in front of me.~
@711 = ~I don't think you're a lunatic. It's okay to speak your mind.~
@712 = ~You may not be a lunatic, but I think your views are chaotic and harmful to society.~
@713 = ~You're thinking too far into this. I suggest you enjoy life and what's been given to you.~
@714 = ~I've been feeling uncomfortable about the way you speak about this. I think we should stop talking now.~
@715 = ~Yep, you're right. You're a bonafide crazy man.~
@716 = ~If I've made you uncomfortable, please know that was never my intention.~
@717 = ~I understand why this would make you feel uncomfortable though, and I won't speak about it again.~
@718 = ~Frankly, I think it would be best if I don't say anything else to you at all. We don't need any tensions in the group, and, if I spoke on, I think I might cause more, and I'm not willing to risk that.~
@719 = ~I'm grateful and truly relieved that you're open-minded.~
@720 = ~Harmful and chaotic? I'm trying to do what's in the best interest of everyone. Everyone can do what they've always wanted to do. Everyone would be content, and there wouldn't be chaos, so there would be no need for laws. Everything would balance itself out.~
@721 = ~I think you're too idealistic and trustworthy of people. That would never work.~
@722 = ~That would be the perfect world, but there's no such thing as perfect.~
@723 = ~Now that you've explained it, that makes sense. I really like that idea, and I hope one day it can be implemented.~ 
@724 = ~That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Your reasonings are so stupid that I just want to slap some sense in you.~
@725 = ~Nevermind, forget I said anything.~
@726 = ~You're right. It would never work, because paradise doesn't exist on Toril.~
@727 = ~You're right... There's no such thing as perfect, I know this.~
@728 = ~Now, I'm ecstatic! I'm glad you like the idea, but I know the world isn't perfect.~
@729 = ~I can understand that, but I know my idea is ridiculous.~
@730 = ~Alright, you can forget what I said before, too.~
@731 = ~I know my idea would never work in a world like this, but, still, it's nice to think about.~
@732 = ~I do enjoy life, but, sometimes, it's fun to think about what-if situations. It's good to keep it in check though. I can't afford to get lost in them. Nothing is worse than being so idealistic that you can't go back into reality, back to reason.~
@733 = ~I can't tell whether you're joking with me or not, but, nonetheless, I know this idea of my mine will never come to fruition. The world isn't perfect.~
@734 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. Speaking about my inner struggles with you have been oddly relieving. It's refreshing to let it all out with little to no judgment, or at least I think so.~
@735 = ~I haven't been completely honest with you, <CHARNAME>. I've been keeping something a secret from you, but, because you've been so understanding, you must know this part about me.~
@736 = ~I said I am a sailor, and I was.~
@737 = ~And..?~
@738 = ~Yeah, because you can't be a sailor because you don't have a boat to sail on.~
@739 = ~Get to the point already.~
@740 = ~That's not what I meant, but, to an extent, you're right. Unfortunately, that's not what I was referring to.~
@741 = ~I don't know how to dance around this anymore, but, <CHARNAME>, I was and am a pirate.~
@742 = ~I didn't want to lie to you about this in case you run into the law and they think you're harboring a criminal. Trust me when I say I wouldn't put you in harm's way. You've been a good friend to me, and I'd hate to see anything bad happen to you because I didn't tell you about my... occupation.~
@743 = ~A pirate? Really? That's what the build up was about?~
@744 = ~I don't care if you're a pirate, Zakrion. You can hold yourself in battle, and that's all that matters to me.~
@745 = ~Who cares if you're a pirate, Zakrion? What matters most to me is that you're a decent person.~
@746 = ~You're a pirate? You're a criminal - a scoundrel!~ 
@747 = ~Why did you lie to me this whole time? You endangered not just me but this entire group!~
@748 = ~You being a pirate doesn't change anything, but thanks for telling me.~
@749 = ~Yes..?~
@750 = ~I don't care if you're a pirate, Zakrion. You can hold yourself in battle, and that's all that matters to me.~
@751 = ~Who cares if you're a pirate, Zakrion? What matters most to me is that you're a decent person.~
@752 = ~You're a pirate? You're a criminal - a scoundrel!~
@753 = ~Why did you lie to me this whole time? You endangered not just me but this entire group!~
@754 = ~You being a pirate doesn't change anything, but thanks for telling me.~
@755 = ~I was worried you were going to say something along those lines. I can't change who I am, <CHARNAME>. I won't change who I am.~
@756 = ~If you won't change, then you can leave.~
@757 = ~Tell me why I should keep you in this group.~
@758 = ~I was kidding, I don't care if you're a pirate.~
@759 = ~I'm sorry... I overreacted, it shouldn't matter if you're a pirate or not.~
@760 = ~I'm sad it had to come down to this, but I won't change who I am for you.~
@761 = ~Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. It was a pleasure traveling with you.~
@762 = ~I'm not going to stand here and persuade you on why I should be here. I think my worth in this group has been proven over and over again.~
@763 = ~If you don't think so, then I don't know what else to say to you.~
@764 = ~That's not good enough.~
@765 = ~You proved to me that you're capable, but I can't accept that you're a pirate.~
@766 = ~You're right. Forget I said anything.~
@767 = ~Right. So, what do you think or what will you do?~
@768 = ~I don't care if you're a pirate, Zakrion. You can hold yourself in battle, and that's all that matters to me.~
@769 = ~Who cares if you're a pirate, Zakrion? What matters most to me is that you're a decent person.~
@770 = ~Why did you lie to me this whole time? You endangered not just me but this entire group!~
@771 = ~You being a pirate doesn't change anything, but thanks for telling me.~
@772 = ~I couldn't have lied to you if I never told you.~
@773 = ~I didn't want to endanger any of you.~
@774 = ~I believe you, but you need to change.~
@775 = ~You need to leave. I don't like liars.~
@776 = ~I believe you, but I no longer feel comfortable around you. I think you need to leave.~
@777 = ~Wait, you don't care?~
@778 = ~Oh gods, I've never been so relieved in my life, and I thought removing my shirt when I had all that blubber when I was a child was freeing...~
@779 = ~Thank you once again, <CHARNAME>, for not asking me to change. I've never experienced so much freedom until I was a pirate. Yes, being a sailor allowed me to be on the sea, but the thrill of pirating is glorious.~
@780 = ~No laws, no expectations, it is what you make it. I am the black sheep, and I have the power to break free from the flock - I have broken free.~
@781 = ~I live a life of uncertainty, and I wouldn't change it for the world.~
@782 = ~I've said this too many times by now, but, really, thank you for understanding and accepting me, <CHARNAME>. If only there were more people in the world like you, Toril would be a more interesting place.~
@783 = ~Waking up every day and knowing I'll be traveling with you is like being onboard a ship again. The ocean may be unpredictable, but that's the fun part.~
@784 = ~It's almost comparable to opening a gift on your birthday. You know it's a box, but what's going to be in the box?~
@785 = ~That's good to hear, and it's good to have you on board the team.~
@786 = ~That's an interesting way of looking at it. That wouldn't be my first comparison though.~
@787 = ~Are you saying that traveling every day with me is comparable to opening a present on your birthday?~
@788 = ~Your comparisons are the worst. They make no sense.~
@789 = ~The comparison was only there to help get the point across, and I think it served its purpose.~
@790 = ~Yes, that's exactly what I mean.~
@791 = ~Ha! They may be the worst, but I think they are able to get the point across, so it can't be a complete and utter failure.~
@792 = ~It feels good to be on the team, <CHARNAME>.~
@793 = ~I didn't think anything could be compared to sailing the sea, but this is a close second for me.~
@794 = ~So, after all this is over, what do you plan on doing?~
@795 = ~What will it take to make you stay on land?~
@796 = ~Sounds like you know what you're doing after this.~
@797 = ~I'm glad I could give you this experience.~
@798 = ~How can you make a fish live without water?~
@799 = ~You could say that.~
@800 = ~I'm glad too, but there is only one love for me.~
@801 = ~I want to go back home, back onto the sea where I belong.~
@802 = ~I want to feel the salty breeze hit me as I climb atop the crow's nest and hear the seagulls calling. Perhaps I'll see an albatross soaring magnificently above me as my ship sails in its direction.~
@803 = ~I'll miss traveling with you though. I'd offer you a place in my crew as my second mate if my crew mates were to accept you. You'll have to earn your place as my first mate, but something tells me a pirate's life isn't for you. That or you may want to go back home and rest.~
@804 = ~Either way, you're free to do what you will, but you're always welcome on my ship.~
@805 = ~What if I said I wanted to travel the world with you?~
@806 = ~I wouldn't mind being a pirate for a few days.~
@807 = ~You're right. I can't wait to go back home and finally relax.~
@808 = ~I think I want to see more of the world first.~
@809 = ~I'd say you've gone batshit crazy.~
@810 = ~I'm only joking, we could talk about it more when this is all done if you like, but I make no promises. We pirates can be fickle on who we let on board our ships.~
@811 = ~That may be so, but we pirates can be fickle on who we let on board our ships.~
@812 = ~I can't blame you for wanting that, especially for all the shit that's been going around you.~
@813 = ~Sounds like something I'd do after this. Best luck on your travels, <CHARNAME>.~
@814 = ~Now, I feel like singing.~
@815 = ~"The pirate I was meant to be, trim the sails and roam the sea..."~ 
@816 = ~Go ahead and sing. It will be nice to listen to something during our travels.~
@817 = ~I think I've heard of that song before.~
@818 = ~You know, I would've never pegged you as a pirate.~
@819 = ~I've never heard of that song before.~
@820 = ~This isn't the time for songs.~
@821 = ~I'm surprised you've heard of that song. It has been sung by pirates far away from this land, far away from this world so I've been told.~
@822 = ~Sure, I get that a lot.~
@823 = ~I don't have a peg leg nor do I have one of those distinctive black hats. I've been told that I don't sound like one either. I think that's a good sign. It helps hide me whenever I return to society.~
@824 = ~However, I assure you, I am a pirate.~
@825 = ~I'm not surprised by that. It has been sung by pirates far away from this land, far away from this world so I've been told.~
@826 = ~Remind me not to invite you to any singing party barges I might attend.~
@827 = ~Today is a good day, <CHARNAME>. A good day for songs and friends.~
@828 = ~<CHARNAME>, your hair looks great in this light. It has a nice... shade to it.~
@829 = ~What are you talking about?~
@830 = ~That was very kind of you. Thank you for the compliment.~
@831 = ~Is this your lame attempt at flirting with me?~
@832 = ~We are keeping this strictly professional, got it? No monkeying around.~
@833 = ~Right. It's probably better that way.~
@834 = ~Your hair, of course. The mop on your head.~
@835 = ~Oh shit, your hair isn't as messy as a mop. Damn it, it isn't messy at all.~
@836 = ~You're welcome.~
@837 = ~Flirting? No, no, I'm just giving you a compliment.~
@838 = ~Your skin looks... looks...~
@839 = ~Damn it all. This was never my strong suit.~
@840 = ~I'll be up-front about this. I like you, <CHARNAME>. I think you are a remarkable woman, and I'd like to get to know you better since we'll be spending a lot of time together.~
@841 = ~I like you too, Zakrion, and I would like to get to know you more.~
@842 = ~Have we not been getting to know each better the whole time?~
@843 = ~You don't have to tell me that twice. If you're feeling this awkward, imagine how I must be feeling on the receiving end of it.~
@844 = ~I'm flattered, but I don't like you in that way, Zakrion.~
@845 = ~I'm not interested in whatever you're trying to sell me, Zakrion.~
@846 = ~I'm not normally this bad at it, but, with you, it's a little different since you are a formidable woman.~
@847 = ~So, you're saying the other women you've been with weren't formidable?~
@848 = ~I understand what you're saying, and I feel the same way about you.~
@849 = ~I know what you're saying, and I'm flattered, but I don't like you in that way, Zakrion.~
@850 = ~I'm not interested in whatever you're trying to sell me, Zakrion.~
@851 = ~Yes -- no! The normal women weren't nearly as capable as you... I mean they were capable in their own way, but they weren't *you*.~
@852 = ~So, I am not a normal woman?~
@853 = ~Wow, thanks for making me feel like a freak.~
@854 = ~Damn it, <CHARNAME>.~
@855 = ~Stop giving me a hard time with this!~
@856 = ~I'm only jesting, I know where you're going with this, and I want to let you know that I like you, too.~
@857 = ~You know, I could argue that we have been getting to know each other already.~
@858 = ~Truthfully, I'm not interested in pursuing this path with you.~
@859 = ~We have, but I'd like to get to know you better in a more intimate manner.~
@860 = ~If you wanted to have sex, that's all you needed to say in the beginning, so we wouldn't have had to go down this rabbit hole.~
@861 = ~I like that idea.~
@862 = ~I'm not interested in you like that, Zakrion.~
@863 = ~Is it really that easy? I'm kidding, only kidding!~
@864 = ~Look, <CHARNAME>. Yeah, I'd like to explore that path with you, but maybe there's something more to it.~
@865 = ~Get rid of the feelings. I'm only interested in the sex part, Zakrion.~
@866 = ~Let's take it slow, but maybe there is something more between us.~
@867 = ~I would like that.~
@868 = ~I'm not interested in you like that, Zakrion.~
@869 = ~Hells, who in their right mind would say no to a woman like you? The feelings are gone, I'm only here for the sex.~
@870 = ~I'll come to you next time we make our tents for the night or if we happen to find ourselves in a tavern.~
@871 = ~Oh, thanks the gods I don't have to spill more words out of my mouth.~
@872 = ~I'm glad to hear that, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad to hear that we're on the same page.~
@873 = ~Hmm.~
@874 = ~Hmm?~
@875 = ~Why are you looking at me like that?~
@876 = ~What was that for?~
@877 = ~Stop making weird sounds.~
@878 = ~What are you thinking about?~
@879 = ~I won't argue with that. You know best, captain.~
@880 = ~You.~
@881 = ~I'm sorry, I'm simply admiring you.~
@882 = ~I didn't think you were a hopeless romantic.~
@883 = ~Thank you, but your flattery isn't needed.~
@884 = ~That's very sweet of you to say.~
@885 = ~That's gross, don't say that again. It's very off-putting.~
@886 = ~I'm not a hopeless romantic. I'm neither hopeless nor romantic.~
@887 = ~It's not an attempt at flattery.~
@888 = ~I'm not trying to make it sound off-putting, because I mean it.~
@889 = ~I like to talk about facts, and it's a fact that you're a formidable woman, whether you attempt to deny that or not.~
@890 = ~How many people struggle to do the simpler things in life? Plowing a plow, herding cattle, filling mugs with ale... these are the simpler things that a normal person would struggle with doing every day.~
@891 = ~But you, you do so much more, you are so much more. No one can hold a candle to what you can do and what you're capable of.~
@892 = ~It's hard not to admire you. It's hard to not like you.~
@893 = ~Thank you, I think you're rather admirable, too.~
@894 = ~Gee, thanks. I appreciate it. You're not so bad yourself.~
@895 = ~I don't think of myself as such, but thank you.~
@896 = ~I think we should remain friends, Zakrion.~
@897 = ~You're kind to say so, but, despite being older than you, it seems like you've lived centuries more than me.~
@898 = ~Not saying you look old, you look quite the opposite! You have the glow only the youth could have, really!~
@899 = ~You're too hard on yourself. The harshest critic is always yourself. If only you could see yourself through my eyes, you'd see the amazing woman that you are.~
@900 = ~Heh, don't mind me and my musings, <CHARNAME>. I know you have better things to do and better people to talk to. Please, carry on.~
@901 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think this is the best way to approach this, and don't get me wrong when I say this.~
@902 = ~I'd like to take things slow with you.~
@903 = ~I'm glad you want to take things slow, because I feel the same way.~
@904 = ~Why do you want to take things slow? I thought it was a pirate's way was to take whatever they wanted whenever they desired.~
@905 = ~Do you not like me enough?~
@906 = ~Slow? Are you kidding me? What's wrong with you?~
@907 = ~Yeah, you're right. We do have the tendency to take what we want when we want it, but you're different.~
@908 = ~Do I not like you enough? I'd think a woman would think I'd like them more if I didn't jump straight into bed with them.~
@909 = ~There's nothing wrong with me, <CHARNAME>. I want to respect you, respect us.~
@910 = ~You don't know how happy I am to hear that.~
@911 = ~It was always my impression that if a man jumps into bed with you the moment he sees you, he doesn't want anything more from you than your body.~
@912 = ~I hope you can understand what I'm telling you.~
@913 = ~I understand, and I want to thank you for wanting to respect me and our relationship.~ 
@914 = ~I don't understand what you're trying to tell me, but you sound genuine.~
@915 = ~I don't understand what you're trying to tell me, but it sounds like an excuse if you ask me.~
@916 = ~I understand, but I don't think it justifies your desire for "taking it slow" with me. Frankly, I find it rather insulting.~
@917 = ~You don't need to thank me for doing what I believe is the right thing to do.~
@918 = ~Because I am genuine when I say I want to respect you.~
@919 = ~It's not an excuse, it's from an excuse. Believe me when I say would like nothing more than to throw you on my bed and fulfill my darkest desire.~
@920 = ~I never thought my form of respect would be insulting to a woman, but, if it makes you feel any better, I'd like nothing more than to throw you on my bed and fulfill my darkest desire.~   
@921 = ~You're a extraordinary woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@922 = ~An extraordinary woman deserves the utmost respect. That's what my father taught me, and I whole-heartedly agree with that.~
@923 = ~He used to treat my mother like royalty. I told you how little he ate when it came to the three of us. My mother and I were his everything, and I know how my father adored my mother.~
@924 = ~I'm not a chivalrous man nor do I think I'll ever be one, but I know the importance of respect.~
@925 = ~Your father taught you well. Respect goes a long way.~
@926 = ~You should've learned some chivalry. I'd like to be given flowers and elegants gifts then showered with poems praising my beauty.~
@927 = ~That's an interesting lesson to be learned. I wish everyone learned to respect others too.~
@928 = ~Respect? That's ironic; you're a pirate. I've never heard of a respectful pirate.~
@929 = ~I spit on respect. It gets you no where in life.~
@930 = ~I said before that he was a good man. He may not have been the most educated man, but he always had a good heart.~
@931 = ~I'm not a knight, and I don't intend to be a knight. I'd rather die than to succumb to the laws that bind the civilized world.~
@932 = ~I won't entertain that thought, <CHARNAME>. If you cared about me, you wouldn't ask this of me, and I can see this is what you want.~
@933 = ~I'll do us both a favor by ending this now. It'll save us the heartache later down the road.~
@934 = ~I wish everyone had some form of respect.~
@935 = ~"Please give me your coin purse, or I'll kill you. So, please, give me all your coins." Imagine a world where thieves had manners!~
@936 = ~Yeah, I guess that sounds ironic, but they exist - I exist.~
@937 = ~I ask people how they would like to die when they're about to die. I go above and beyond when I give them a last meal too, usually... if we have some leftover food on board.~
@938 = ~I doubt you actually do that, but that's funny to think about.~
@939 = ~Wow, you're practically a saint.~
@940 = ~Um, okay, if you say so.~
@941 = ~I don't know what to do with you.~
@942 = ~I really do! But, as I said, there needs to be leftovers first.~
@943 = ~I am, aren't I? Ha! Your sarcasm is phenomenal.~
@944 = ~I know so.~
@945 = ~You don't need to do anything. I'm the one in charge of the food, so I would decide if the prisoner would get to eat or not.~
@946 = ~Sure, I understand what you're saying. However, to the right people, respect means the world.~
@947 = ~Okay, I think I understand.~
@948 = ~I understand now, and thank you for respecting me.~
@949 = ~I still don't understand, but I don't really care anymore.~
@950 = ~Look, I don't want to go slow. In fact, I think you're a coward for wanting to move slow.~
@951 = ~Hm, alright. I can't change your mind, but, if that's what you think, then so be it.~
@952 = ~Ending this now would be good for both of us.~
@953 = ~Anyhow, I'm glad we could reach a conclusion.~
@954 = ~I think this is going to work.~
@955 = ~<CHARNAME>, I need a moment of your time.~
@956 = ~What's wrong?~
@957 = ~Sure, anything you need, just ask.~
@958 = ~We don't have time to stop and talk right now.~
@959 = ~No, I don't think this can wait. It'll take a few seconds, I promise. I need some closure.~
@960 = ~What's wrong?~
@961 = ~Fine, go on, but make it quick.~
@962 = ~No, we can't. There are more important things to do than stopping and talking.~
@963 = ~If you can't find the time to talk to me for a few minutes, then I don't need to spend more time on you.~
@964 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>, for a relationship that was going nowhere.~
@965 = ~It's been nice to have you by my side. In fact, it's been very nice...~
@966 = ~I don't know if...~
@967 = ~(Let him continue speaking.)~
@968 = ~(Kiss him.)~
@969 = ~Come on, spit it out.~
@970 = ~I don't know how I feel about all this.~
@971 = ~I look at you, and I'm so conflicted with myself.~
@972 = ~I -- mhm. You taste wonderful.~
@973 = ~Come on, spit it out.~
@974 = ~(Without another word, he moves closer to you and kisses you fully on your mouth.)~
@975 = ~(Lean into his kiss.)~
@976 = ~(Shove him away.) What the hell was that for?~
@977 = ~Sorry, I don't have an explanation for that. I think I needed to feel you for a small moment... to help me make up my mind.~
@978 = ~Help you make up your mind for what?~
@979 = ~That... was nice.~
@980 = ~Get out of my face, I don't want to see you anymore!~
@981 = ~You said you wanted to respect our relationship. Is this your version of respect?!~ 
@982 = ~Nothing, just nothing. I'm rambling, you know me.~
@983 = ~Yes, it was.~
@984 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I don't know what I was thinking.~
@985 = ~I won't give you an excuse, but I'll do you a favor by ending this. I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, I truly am.~
@986 = ~I -- Mhm. That was unexpected but unexpectedly pleasant.~
@987 = ~I needed that.~
@988 = ~You're a wonderful, wonderful woman, <CHARNAME>. You need to know that, don't forget it.~
@989 = ~This is too much, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry.~
@990 = ~What... What are you talking about?~
@991 = ~Yeah, you're right. We need to find an inn, and take a long rest.~
@992 = ~What are you apologizing for? You haven't done anything wrong.~
@993 = ~Yes, this is too much. You've been acting so strange, and I don't know how I feel about that.~
@994 = ~Are you ending our relationship? Oh, thank the gods, I thought I was going to have to do it.~
@995 = ~That's not what my apology was for. However, I wish it was.~
@996 = ~(sigh) Let's get this over with.~
@997 = ~It's not that I haven't done anything wrong; it's what I'm going to do.~
@998 = ~Oh, so you wanted to end our relationship, too?~
@999 = ~Let's get this over with, then.~
@1000 = ~I've thought about where we'll go after we find and do away with Sarevok.~
@1001 = ~Believe me when I say I've thought about this every night and every time we're on the road, but I've always had only one love: the ocean.~
@1002 = ~I don't know if I'm ready to care for something else or someone else. I don't think there is anything that can compare to the sea. My heart has only enough room for one.~
@1003 = ~You're ending our relationship, aren't you?~
@1004 = ~What are you saying?~
@1005 = ~What was the point of our relationship if you knew you could only care for the ocean?~
@1006 = ~Are you serious? You came to this conclusion after we kissed?~
@1007 = ~You are a piece of shit, Zakrion Dessani. You are a complete waste of time. I can't believe I liked you.~
@1008 = ~I knew it, you're a coward. You're afraid to care about anything but yourself.~
@1009 = ~Yes. Yes, I am.~
@1010 = ~What was the point of our relationship if you knew you could only care for the ocean?~
@1011 = ~Are you serious? You came to this conclusion after we kissed?~
@1012 = ~You are a piece of shit, Zakrion Dessani. You are a complete waste of time. I can't believe I liked you.~
@1013 = ~I knew it, you're a coward. You're afraid to care about anything but yourself.~
@1014 = ~Fine, if that's what you want. Let's end this.~
@1015 = ~I'm ending our relationship.~
@1016 = ~What was the point of our relationship if you knew you could only care for the ocean?~ 
@1017 = ~Are you serious? You came to this conclusion after we kissed?~
@1018 = ~You are a piece of shit, Zakrion Dessani. You are a complete waste of time. I can't believe I liked you.~
@1019 = ~I knew it, you're a coward. You're afraid to care about anything but yourself.~
@1020 = ~Fine, if that's what you want. Let's end this.~
@1021 = ~I thought I could care for you the way you deserved to be cared for.~
@1022 = ~I admired you, I still admire you, but I'd be lying to you if I said I could give up the ocean for you. Even if you came with me, I don't think it would work out.~
@1023 = ~Yeah, I know that doesn't paint me in the best light, but you deserve to know the truth.~
@1024 = ~I know, I know. I can't blame you for thinking that I'm a piece of shit. I'd think the same thing if I were in your place.~
@1025 = ~Yeah, maybe I am a coward, but I don't want to risk losing what I love the most. I don't see how I could care about anything more than sailing on the ocean and being free from society's laws.~
@1026 = ~Yes, this is what I want. I am sure of it.~
@1027 = ~This wasn't easy for me, <CHARNAME>, but the decision had to be made.~
@1028 = ~No! I won't accept this - we can work it out!~
@1029 = ~Fine, this relationship didn't mean anything to me anyway.~
@1030 = ~Honestly, I don't agree with what you said, but it seems like you've already made up your mind.~
@1031 = ~You're probably right, and I'm glad you were honest with me about this.~
@1032 = ~Fuck you, get out of my sight. I don't want to see you ever again.~
@1033 = ~No, we can't.~
@1034 = ~Yes, my mind has already been made up.~
@1035 = ~I really did enjoy our time together.~
@1036 = ~Thank you for being so understanding. That's one of the amazing qualities you have.~
@1037 = ~I really did enjoy our time together.~
@1038 = ~Sure, sure. I'll go, don't worry.~
@1039 = ~I don't think we'll cross each other's paths again.~
@1040 = ~This isn't about what's happened so far or who you are. It's just better this way.~
@1041 = ~I hope you know that I really did enjoy our time together. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@1042 = ~I'm sorry it had to end this way, <CHARNAME>, but this is for the best.~
@1043 = ~This isn't about what's happened so far or who you are. It's just better this way.~
@1044 = ~I said I'd visit you at night, didn't I? I'm here.~
@1045 = ~Good, I was expecting you.~
@1046 = ~Take your shirt off.~
@1047 = ~I don't know how I feel about this...~
@1048 = ~On second thought, nevermind. I don't want to do this.~
@1049 = ~I am a man of my word, after all. I wouldn't leave a beautiful woman like you all by herself when my company has been requested.~
@1050 = ~I like women who know what they want, and this only reinforces why exercising is good for me.~
@1051 = ~If you don't know how you feel about this, I'm going to leave.~
@1052 = ~No! Don't leave, please stay.~
@1053 = ~Take your shirt off.~
@1054 = ~I think it would be best that you leave.~
@1055 = ~You're a tease, <CHARNAME>, but I bet you already knew that.~
@1056 = ~Fine, it's probably best we had a more professional relationship between us.~
@1057 = ~Let's have a night neither of us will forget any time soon.~
@1058 = ~Come here, <CHARNAME>...~
@1059 = ~The past nights have been nothing short of glorious, <CHARNAME>.~
@1060 = ~I wouldn't mind having you on board my ship every night.~
@1061 = ~I thought we said no to commitments.~
@1062 = ~I wouldn't mind having you with me every night as well.~
@1063 = ~I think I might be catching feelings for you...~
@1064 = ~You're up for another round tonight, right?~
@1065 = ~I don't want to talk right now. Let's just go to bed.~
@1066 = ~No talking? Fine by me, let's get to bed, then.~
@1067 = ~That isn't a commitment. I said I wouldn't mind having you on board my ship every *night*. During the day, I don't care where you go or what you do, as long as you're mine at night.~
@1068 = ~Good. That's what I like to hear.~
@1069 = ~Hey, no. We spoke about this before, and we're not doing this.~
@1070 = ~I'm a man of my word, and I thought you'd be a woman of your word.~
@1071 = ~I think we should stop this now. Goodnight, <CHARNAME>.~
@1072 = ~I'm always up for another round.~
@1073 = ~Now, I've been wanting to try something for a while now...~
@1074 = ~Are you tired, <CHARNAME>?~
@1075 = ~No, of course not, that's why I'm definitely not going to bed right now. Yes, Zakrion, I am tired.~
@1076 = ~I'm not too tired where I can't speak to you. What's going on?~ 
@1077 = ~I think someone is getting a little frisky.~
@1078 = ~Actually, I wanted to take this time to get some alone time with you.~
@1079 = ~Go away, Zakrion. I'm not in the mood.~
@1080 = ~No, it's not that.~
@1081 = ~I need to get this off my chest, <CHARNAME>, before I let you sleep.~
@1082 = ~I won't be joining you from here on out. Hear me out before you say anything or come to any conclusions.~
@1083 = ~Our nights together have been great, don't get me wrong. It was fun while it lasted, but, after Sarevok, I want to be back on a ship sailing the world again.~
@1084 = ~But I could come with you!~
@1085 = ~Are you breaking up with me?~
@1086 = ~I think that would probably be best for the both of us.~
@1087 = ~No hard feelings. There wasn't any strings attached to this anyway.~
@1088 = ~Yeah, you could, but I don't want you to.~
@1089 = ~I was afraid you'd let your feelings get in the way and, as a future captain to my future crew, I don't want to have favorites.~
@1090 = ~It's better this way, <CHARNAME>. Like I said, it was fun while it lasted.~
@1091 = ~NO! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!~
@1092 = ~You have a point, and I think our separation would be good for us.~
@1093 = ~No hard feelings. There wasn't any strings attached to this anyway.~
@1094 = ~I can do this to you, and I will.~
@1095 = ~Let this go, <CHARNAME>. Let's at least be cordial with each other for our last remaining days together.~
@1096 = ~I said NO!~
@1097 = ~Fine, I accept this separation, although I am very unwilling to accept this.~
@1098 = ~Alright, I'm sorry for making this more than it was.~
@1099 = ~And I said yes.~
@1100 = ~I'm done, <CHARNAME>. Whatever we had going on is done. Get over it, I've already gotten over you.~
@1101 = ~Thanks.~
@1102 = ~Like I said before, it was fun while it lasted.~
@1103 = ~There's nothing to break if there was no relationship to break to begin with.~
@1104 = ~But I could come with you!~
@1105 = ~You have a point, and I think our separation would be good for us.~
@1106 = ~No hard feelings. There wasn't any strings attached to this anyway.~
@1107 = ~I'm glad you feel that way. You've made my life a lot easier for taking it so well.~
@1108 = ~Like I said, it was fun while it lasted. Best of luck to you on your future travels.~
@1109 = ~Passing notes was always a fun childhood thing I used to do, but they were never about putting bounties on other people's head.~
@1110 = ~Not to mention, I struggled too much trying to find the perfect signature when signing my notes.~
@1111 = ~I've wanted to sign official documents with a big "Z", but I never had to sign an official document yet.~
@1112 = ~Sorry, that's most likely not what you wanted to hear after getting attacked by an assassin, bounty hunter, whatever you'd like to call them. I'm glad you're alive.~
@1113 = ~I've been hearing you tossing and turning in your sleep. Nightmares?~
@1114 = ~Yeah, something like that.~
@1115 = ~Yes, they were terrifying.~
@1116 = ~No, I don't know what I was dreaming of.~
@1117 = ~No, it's just a stupid dream.~
@1118 = ~I used to have nightmares when my mother left.~
@1119 = ~It was the same dream over and over again.~
@1120 = ~I would be on a tall cliff overlooking the ocean, and someone would push me from behind. I'd feel myself falling and falling, but, right before I hit the ocean, I'd always wake up.~
@1121 = ~They say that when you die in a dream, you die in real life. Maybe that's why I never experienced death in my dreams.~
@1122 = ~Maybe that's why I always wake up right before I'm about to break all the bones in my body.~
@1123 = ~I'm glad the little girl was able to get her cat back, at least the corpse of the cat. I remember the happiness of having a companion.~
@1124 = ~A companion? You had a pet?~
@1125 = ~Aw, what was it?~
@1126 = ~Cool story, but let's get back on the road now.~
@1127 = ~*She* is the product of a wizard's experiment, or so I assumed. She had the face and tail of a cat but the body of a fluffy monkey.~
@1128 = ~I found the poor girl all raggedy near a garden eating buttercups. So that's how she got her name - Buttercup.~
@1129 = ~I miss the little girl.~
@1130 = ~What happened to her?~
@1131 = ~I'm sorry for your loss.~
@1132 = ~You're lying to me - half cat and half monkey?~
@1133 = ~Cool story, but let's get back on the road now.~
@1134 = ~No, not a pet, a companion. The little girl's name was Buttercup.~
@1135 = ~She is the product of a wizard's experiment, or so I assumed. She had the face and tail of a cat but the body of a fluffy monkey.~
@1136 = ~I found the poor girl all raggedy near a garden eating buttercups. So that's how she got her name - Buttercup.~
@1137 = ~I miss the little girl.~
@1138 = ~What happened to her?~
@1139 = ~I'm sorry for your loss.~
@1140 = ~You're lying to me - half cat and half monkey?~
@1141 = ~Cool story, but let's get back on the road now.~
@1142 = ~Yeah, sure, let's get to it.~
@1143 = ~Oh, she's not dead.~
@1144 = ~I wish she was here with me to prove to you I'm not lying. I'm a man of my word, <CHARNAME>.~
@1145 = ~She's with a friend, and thank the gods I let her stay with a friend before my ship wrecked.~
@1146 = ~All I know is she's well taken care of, which is all I could ask for.~ 
@1147 = ~And I thought being a pirate in this society was bad.~
@1148 = ~I don't know whether to tell you that you're shit out of luck or... well, you're shit out of luck, <CHARNAME>.~
@1149 = ~Wow, thanks for the vote of confidence, Zakrion.~
@1150 = ~My head is still spinning from the news.~
@1151 = ~Zakrion, I don't know how I feel about this. Please, hold me.~
@1152 = ~I'm the <PRO_SONDAUGHTER> of a god. I feel so empowered.~
@1153 = ~Yeah, well, I'm still a person, so let's just move on.~
@1154 = ~Sure, sure. If you're okay with it, let's move on.~
@1155 = ~That's what I'm here for.~
@1156 = ~My head would be spinning too, if I found out I was the son of a god, Bhaal no less.~
@1157 = ~Sure, sure. Come here.~
@1158 = ~If you don't mind me saying, it feels a little strange holding the daughter of Bhaal.~
@1159 = ~Ah shit, I'm with the daughter of Bhaal. I wonder if your father would like that, if he was alive.~
@1160 = ~Shut up, and just hold me.~
@1161 = ~Ugh, why do you have to ruin this for me?~
@1162 = ~Thank you for your support, I needed that.~
@1163 = ~Your voice is so comforting to me, but I think your body would be more comforting to me right now...~
@1164 = ~Yeah, sure, I can do that.~
@1165 = ~... As much as this is comforting to you, we can't stay like this forever.~
@1166 = ~Right. I'll shut up.~
@1167 = ~Sure, sure. You know I'm here for you.~
@1168 = ~Right now?~
@1169 = ~I don't think this is the best time, especially when you've learned this massive piece of information.~
@1170 = ~We'll take it easy tonight.~
@1171 = ~Empowered? That's one way of putting it. Truthfully, my head would be spinning out of control.~
@1172 = ~If there's one thing I've learned about you, <CHARNAME>, it's that you're resilient.~
@1173 = ~You might be the spawn of Bhaal, but you are still <CHARNAME>. You're still your own person. Don't forget that.~
@1174 = ~We have a lot of ground to cover and while this new found knowledge is shocking to hear, we have to keep moving.~
@1175 = ~Before we start pursuing our enemies again, I want to let you know you are a resilient woman. Your heritage doesn't define who you are - you are still your own person. Don't forget that.~
@1176 = ~I always hate seeing a ship crash. It reminds me of my own crashes.~
@1177 = ~The sooner I get out of this crash's vicinity the better. Anything is better than this wreck...~
@1178 = ~<CHARNAME>! Care for a drink? It's on me.~
@1179 = ~Ha! I knew I liked you for a good reason!~
@1180 = ~How could I turn down a drink if you're buying?~
@1181 = ~Thanks for the offer, Zakrion, but I don't drink.~
@1182 = ~No, I don't want to drink with the likes of you.~
@1183 = ~Your loss, captain. I can't say I'm disappointed, especially when I have more coin to spend on myself!~
@1184 = ~Excellent!~
@1185 = ~So, tell me, how well can you hold your liquor?~
@1186 = ~Better than you can.~
@1187 = ~Not very well.~
@1188 = ~I'm not sure, I've never drank until I passed out.~
@1189 = ~On second thought, nevermind.~
@1190 = ~Is that a challenge?~
@1191 = ~Maybe, maybe not.~
@1192 = ~It sure is.~
@1193 = ~Of course not, I'm just stating a fact.~
@1194 = ~I'm taking that as a yes!~
@1195 = ~That's too bad, but it never hurts to down a drink or two, especially during trying times.~
@1196 = ~Let's take an hour or two to relax and grab a couple pints of ale.~
@1197 = ~Never drank until --, <CHARNAME>! You really have been sheltered your whole life!~
@1198 = ~Let's take an hour or two to get you well acquainted with the drinks so, next time, we can have ourselves a little match.~
@1199 = ~I do like a good challenge - but since we have to hit the ground running in an hour or two, let's take this challenge lightly.~
@1200 = ~Let's say... the first one to drink three pints is the winner, and here comes the first round - let the games begin!~
@1201 = ~The Blushing Mermaid... it's an interesting name. It reminds me of a certain someone.~
@1202 = ~Don't tell you went to bed with a mermaid before.~
@1203 = ~Would you like to see me blush?~
@1204 = ~Who or what are you referring to?~
@1205 = ~Please, not again with your meaningless banters.~
@1206 = ~Thanks for the compliment, but now isn't a good time.~
@1207 = ~Not right now, Zakrion.~
@1208 = ~Damn, well, you know where to find me if you have the urge to.~
@1209 = ~I think I detect a hint of jealousy.~
@1210 = ~But no, <CHARNAME>, I've never been with a mermaid. I'm not even sure if it's possible to --~
@1211 = ~I'm not going to entertain that thought, especially when I have you here with me.~
@1212 = ~Would you like to see me blush?~
@1213 = ~Oh? Is that so? Would you like to... have some fun?~
@1214 = ~Thanks for the compliment, but now isn't a good time.~
@1215 = ~Not right now, Zakrion.~
@1216 = ~Very much so.~
@1217 = ~You. When you're in bed with me.~
@1218 = ~Oh.~
@1219 = ~Oh? Is that so? Would you like to... have some fun?~
@1220 = ~Would you like to see me blush again?~
@1221 = ~Thanks for the compliment, but now isn't a good time.~
@1222 = ~You're blushing already. It seems that we have a head start already...~
@1223 = ~Meaningless? It's far from meaningless. I'd like to see *you* as my blushing mermaid.~
@1224 = ~Oh? Is that so? I like the sound of that.~
@1225 = ~Thanks for the compliment, but now isn't a good time.~
@1226 = ~Not right now, Zakrion.~
@1227 = ~Of course, but you know where to find me if you have the urge to.~
@1228 = ~Let's find a room. Soon.~
@1229 = ~It seems the more we unfold of your adventure, the more sinister the plot gets.~
@1230 = ~I don't even think we can call this an adventure anymore. It's a fight for survival now if anything.~ 
@1231 = ~Yeah, it hasn't been an adventure for a while now.~
@1232 = ~It's an even better adventure than when it started!~
@1233 = ~You don't say.~
@1234 = ~It's not as fun as it used to be, I wish I could go back to Candlekeep, before this all began.~
@1235 = ~I've enjoyed the freedom I've had. I kill, pillage, and do whatever I please.~
@1236 = ~I don't think you will ever be able to live the life you once had, <CHARNAME>.~
@1237 = ~Yeah, I guess it is. You take twists of events very well.~
@1238 = ~Yeah, I know I'm pointing out the obvious, but no one was saying it.~
@1239 = ~That's one way to look at it.~
@1240 = ~You've amassed quite a bit of excitement in your life already.~
@1241 = ~And quite a bit of gold.~
@1242 = ~Are you jealous?~
@1243 = ~Eh, it's just more things to carry to be honest with you.~
@1244 = ~Yeah, I have so much gold I don't even know what do with it.~
@1245 = ~I plan on amassing more gold too.~
@1246 = ~A bit, yeah, I'll admit I am.~
@1247 = ~So you are...~
@1248 = ~I don't know how else to ask this, <CHARNAME>, so I'll just ask.~
@1249 = ~You already know I've been scrounging around for funds for my ship, I haven't even started saving for my crew yet.~
@1250 = ~The shitty move would be to say that I'm a part of this group and so I deserve a portion of the money we've gathered.~
@1251 = ~I won't say that though. What I will say is that I'd like to lighten your load, and I promise it's for a good cause.~
@1252 = ~How much would you need?~ 
@1253 = ~Zakrion, this is the party's gold so you have a right to your portion.~
@1254 = ~There's no way I'm parting with a single coin.~
@1255 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. I really appreciate it, but I should probably tell you the amount needed first before you willingly give away all your coins.~
@1256 = ~Fine, you leave me with no choice.~
@1257 = ~I have been risking my life to fight alongside you. I am owed that money.~
@1258 = ~Fine, fine. How much do you need?~
@1259 = ~What about I give you five thousand coins to sate your pennylust?~
@1260 = ~You heard me. You aren't getting anything from me.~
@1261 = ~I wasn't asking for your permission.~
@1262 = ~Ten thousand coins would get me all the supplies I need, a medium-sized ship, a crew, and then some.~
@1263 = ~I'd be good to go for at least three years if I give myself the worse case scenario.~
@1264 = ~Done. Here you go.~
@1265 = ~As I said before, a portion of the money is yours to take.~
@1266 = ~That's too much. What about five thousand?~
@1267 = ~Hell no, that's too much money.~
@1268 = ~Eight thousand.~
@1269 = ~Done. Here you go.~
@1270 = ~Hell no, that's too much money.~
@1271 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. This will go a long way. I might even name my ship after you. We'll see.~
@1272 = ~I could already smell the salty ocean water before we walked in.~
@1273 = ~These men are sailors no doubt... and this will be a good place for me to start looking for a crew once this is all over.~
@1274 = ~This might be inappropriate for me to ask, but I need to know.~
@1275 = ~Are you okay, <CHARNAME>?~ 
@1276 = ~Why would I not be? Are you okay?~
@1277 = ~Is this about our 'relationship'?~
@1278 = ~I'm doing better than ever!~
@1279 = ~I'm doing fine, thanks for asking.~
@1280 = ~I've had better days.~
@1281 = ~I still can't get over how much of a piece of shit you are.~
@1282 = ~I don't want to talk to you anymore, Zakrion. Leave me alone.~
@1283 = ~That's fair. I'll leave you alone.~
@1284 = ~I hope we can come to a common ground in the future. I... do miss our talks.~
@1285 = ~But, yeah, I'll leave you to it.~
@1286 = ~Good. I'm glad to hear that.~
@1287 = ~I see. I've had better days, too.~
@1288 = ~I thought I would check in on you and see how you were doing.~
@1289 = ~I know our relationship ended abruptly, but I still care for you and how you feel. You're the captain after all.~
@1290 = ~I don't want to disrupt your... concentration. A captain needs to stay focused.~
@1291 = ~You don't need to worry about my 'concentration'. I have everything under control.~
@1292 = ~Thanks for checking up on me, but it's not your job to do that.~
@1293 = ~I appreciate it, Zakrion, I really do.~
@1294 = ~And as your captain, I suggest you get back in line.~
@1295 = ~Yeah, I know. You're a very capable woman, one of the most capable woman I've ever met.~
@1296 = ~I'm glad to hear that. I do hope you know that I only want the best for you.~
@1297 = ~I... nothing. It's nothing.~
@1298 = ~Let's get back on the road. The sooner we get this over with, the sooner I can return to the sea.~
@1299 = ~I've never been more scared of a child in my life than now.~
@1300 = ~Either she's delusional or the Bitch Queen favors her, and by the gods, I hope it's the first.~
@1301 = ~For fuck's sake, I thought I would walk the plank first before seeing you again.~
@1302 = ~Harassed by the Bitch Queen? These fools must have done something to provoke her... or maybe they caught Umberlee on a bad day.~
@1303 = ~Sink me, we've hit rough seas.~
@1304 = ~Talos and Umberlee are not to be trifled with, <CHARNAME>. We should have let them sort their situation out themselves.~
@1305 = ~It will all be fine in the end. Have faith, Zakrion.~
@1306 = ~What are you scared of?~
@1307 = ~Can you tell me more about Umberlee?~
@1308 = ~Can you tell me more about Talos?~
@1309 = ~What is done is done. All we can do now is move forward.~
@1310 = ~<CHARNAME>, you may not have any desire to sail across the sea, but I do.~
@1311 = ~The wrath of Umberlee and Talos is inevitable, much like how we know the albatross are going to shit on the shit deck.~
@1312 = ~For fuck's sake, I may be doomed to stay on land for the rest of my life.~
@1313 = ~Umberlee, The Wavemother, The Bitch Queen, The Great Queen of the Sea.~
@1314 = ~Sailors worship her out of fear and as a typical tribute, we toss out a few of our valuables in the hopes of appeasing her during a voyage.~
@1315 = ~There was this one time where my father and I were battling the rough seas. It was right after a good haul, too, so we had plenty of valuables onboard the ship.~
@1316 = ~The seas were angry at us, and we were all growing desperate.~
@1317 = ~We tossed out a fortune of gems and coins in less than an hour, but the sea only became angrier. We had to toss out good 'ole Bessie and that finally seemed to sate The Bitch Queen.~
@1318 = ~I only hope we don't meet Bessie's fate.~
@1319 = ~Talos, The Storm Lord, The Destroyer, The Stormstar.~
@1320 = ~He treats destruction as one of his square meals. It's his favorite meal, and he never gets tired of it.~
@1321 = ~Any time I set sail, I make sure I give a quick prayer to Talos. I'll cause a little havoc, too, if I know the voyage is going to be rough.~
@1322 = ~My crew and I would, ah, let's say we would cause some trouble to the local guards and leave it like that.~
@1323 = ~I only hope Talos doesn't turn to us and decides to cause mass destruction in our lives.~
@1324 = ~That's easy for you to say.~
@1325 = ~You handled that beautifully, <CHARNAME>.~
@1326 = ~We shouldn't be angering any deities, especially The Storm Lord and The Bitch Queen. I would very much like to return to the seas without having a deity at my back.~
@1327 = ~I don't know how I feel about it, but I didn't want to incur the wrath of either deity.~
@1328 = ~Thanks, it's best not to get involved with another's quarrel, especially a dispute between gods and goddesses.~
@1329 = ~I don't care about a petty argument. It's not my problem.~
@1330 = ~Good thinking, captain. That's what is going to keep us alive.~
