@88888 = ~A Hidden Book

A young elven lady, by the name of Minyae, offered me her services if I helped retrieve a tome for her. Her request seems easy enough. Go inside a room, find the book, pick it up, and go. That's all there is to it...right?~

Lies! As soon as we walked into the room, there was a lich! Minyae must have known what was beyond the door, she wouldn't have asked for our help otherwise. But nonetheless, we obtained the tome. I should definitely keep an eye on her.~
