@102 = ~You have a point. I guess I can't blame you for that, but you need to be able to trust me.~
@103 = ~Trust you? As I said before, you wouldn't have believed me or you wouldn't have helped me if I had told you of the lich.~
@104 = ~But I suppose you could be right, maybe one day I'll be able to trust you with such information.~

@119 = ~Because I don't.~ [QI#Mi041]
@120 = ~But to humor you until next time so you don't gawk at me while we are traveling, I believe my parents died when I was young.  The only piece of information about my family that I remember is my name, Minyae Beaurin.~
@121 = ~But you must have grown up somewhere.~
@122 = ~So you're an orphan?~ 
@123 = ~I wasn't gawking at you at all. I think you are self-conscious.~ 
@124 = ~There's no need to be rude about it. It was just a simple question.~ 
@125 = ~I don't expect you to understand.~
@126 = ~I suppose you can call me an orphan. I would jump town to town when I was younger, always staying near a road, but I was also close to the forest. The forest kept me safe, and the road provided me with targets.~
@127 = ~I wasn't going to give you any sympathies. You seem independent enough.~
@128 = ~What do you mean by targets?~
@129 = ~Good. I was and still am independent enough to handle myself on my own. But my targets couldn't.~
@130 = ~My targets were those I could profit from, whether it be coin or food. I wanted it all. The perfect targets were lone merchants traveling through a road in which they thought they were safe.~ [QI#Mi042]
@131 = ~Me, being the astute child I was, knew that no one would help this poor merchant as they were casually walking by, humming their little tunes. And why would they not help a small, dirty child crying out for any nutritious substance?~
@132 = ~As soon as they would bend down to give me an apple or whatever object they thought would sate me, I would knick their coin purse. So simple, so easy, and the best part was that they never knew.~
@133 = ~Wow, you were a terrible child.~
@134 = ~Well, if that's what you need to do to survive, then that's what you need to do.~
@135 = ~Why didn't you just kill them and take everything they had?~
@136 = ~Terrible? You mean terribly smart and witty.~
@137 = ~That's precisely what I thought as a child. I felt guilty in that fact that I had stolen someone's hard-earned coin.~
@138 = ~But then I finally came to terms that I needed it more than them. And that nothing was more important than myself.~
@139 = ~And risk losing potential targets? No, that would be idiotic.~
@140 = ~Do you know what would have happened if I killed those isolated merchants? Their families would eventually worry about their whereabouts and realize that they are missing. They would send a search party to trace back beloved's steps. Sooner or later, I would have been caught, and who knows what those savages would do to me.~
@141 = ~Stating the obvious bores me. We are done talking for now.~
@142 = ~Whatever you need to tell yourself to make yourself feel better, sure. But I will sate your curiousity nonetheless.~
@143 = ~And now I tire of this conversation.~
@144 = ~Now, if you don't mind. I have more important things to attend to.~
@145 = ~Simply because wherever you go, there will be more to learn.~

@148 = ~Every day we are constantly learning. Every day is a new day to experience more and more.~
@149 = ~So where did you come from?~
@150 = ~I agree with your statement. You seem like you can handle yourself on your own pretty well.~ 
@151 = ~I don't agree with that.~
@152 = ~I was not expecting someone with your stature to accept that obvious fact anyways. But I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, since you are capable, and I do have my reasons. I learned my ways when I was still a child.~
@153 = ~Power through knowledge.~ [QI#Mi043]
@154 = ~Is that all you are looking for? Power and knowledge does not mean everything.~
@155 = ~Ah, I can understand that.~
@156 = ~Your idea of what defines power is ridiculous. It is always brawns over brains, and you obviously don't have brawns.~
@157 = ~Ha! And what else is there in the world? It was knowledge which provided me with the means to survive, and it was knowledge that allowed me to stay alive! I learned my ways when I was but a child!~
@158 = ~That's good to know.  I learned my ways when I was naught but a child.~
@159 = ~Brute force over brains? You are even more obtuse than I thought.~
@160 = ~Can you even begin to imagine a world without the slightest grain of intelligence? We would all be bumbling barbarians with endless wars over menial things such as whose son is the strongest or what tribes corn is more yellow.~
@161 = ~Your lack of judgment and good sense disappoints me greatly. I did not realize the leader of this band of unfortunate souls was being lead by a dolt.~
@162 = ~We no longer have anything to discuss. It is clear that you are no simpler than a commoner.~
@163 = ~Oh? Then you have wasted my time, and now I demand a favor from you.~
@164 = ~Demand a favor from me? You are in no position to demand anything from me.~
@165 = ~Go ahead. What's the favor?~
@166 = ~I don't have time for idle banter.  If I want to talk to you, I will talk to you. But vice versa? I don't think so.~
@167 = ~If I allow you to ask me questions.  Then I am allowed to ask you favors.~
@168 = ~Next time you have any inquiries for me, instead of staring like a buffoon, ask your questions.~
@169 = ~Fair enough. I guess I do have a question or two for you.~
@170 = ~Okay fine, here is a question for you: where do you hail from?~
@171 = ~Your demands from me are meaningless. I do not care for what you have to say, but you should care about what I have to say to you.~ 
@172 = ~Next time when you have any inquiries for me, instead of staring like a buffoon, ask your questions.~
@173 = ~If you think that will work, I'm afraid you're wrong. But I will take this as a good sign.~
@174 = ~I will no longer have to listen to your horrid voice.~
@175 = ~Then stop wasting daylight and ask.~

@185 = ~Dare I ask what measures you will take to achieve this?~
@186 = ~Any means possible.~ 
@187 = ~Within reason of course.~
@188 = ~I desire power and glory so that I may protect the poor and aid the weak.~
@189 = ~I would say that is a relatively good answer, but at the same time, it is a moronic answer.~
@190 = ~When you say that you will achieve something by "any means possible", it is clearly not possible. What do you have to give that is useful that does not include your life? The life of others? They are already meaningless to you.~
@191 = ~I take it back then, I don't know what I would do.~
@192 = ~The lives of others do matter. If I could avoid it, I would not harm a single soul.~
@193 = ~I suppose your words have meaning to them.~
@194 = ~And now you take back your words? You do not have the strength or the willpower to backup your answer?~
@195 = ~I see it as a weakness to be indecisive.~
@196 = ~Well, what do you want me to say?~
@197 = ~You're right, I should be assertive in what I say.~
@198 = ~I do not care what you think, I can think however I want.~

@200 = ~But because you are the leader of this group or at least the center of attention here, your decisions weigh heavily on what we do and how we are able to achieve it. If you are hesitant on such significant matters, surely your quest will fail and those following you will perish.~

@204 = ~Why does it matter who I choose?~
@205 = ~And what if I were to go out of my way for someone like that?~
@206 = ~I would obviously further my own goals. I have no time for such menial tasks.~
@207 = ~Please explain to me what these hoi polloi have done for you. Did they give birth to you? Do they shield you from harm?~ [QI#Mi045]
@208 = ~No, if they could, they would use you as fodder. If they could, they would take away anything and everything that you hold dear. If you were to lay dying here, do you know what the commonfolk would do? They would take away all of your valuables and leave you to die a slow, painful death.~
@209 = ~People are tools, why should you treat them differently?~
@210 = ~You are wrong. I no longer want to hear your evil words. You will be silent from now on.~

@223 = ~That's a horrible thing to say! Everyone should have chance to live, no one is lesser than the other person. All of our lives are equal.~
@224 = ~And you would be correct in your assumption.~

@283 = ~Now, where was I before I was so rudely interrupted? Ah, I remember...~
@284 = ~At least now I know this very significant piece of information. I won't have to waste my breath speaking to you anymore.~
@285 = ~Well let me refresh your addled brain.~
@286 = ~You made some inquiries about my past, and I gave you the answers you sought. We discussed how I survived my childhood and teenaged years.~
@287 = ~But I am not here to re-tell you the same information I already said once before.~
@288 = ~But I do have a story to tell you.~
@289 = ~When I was a young girl, I used to wait and watch for merchant caravans to pass through the forests where I would reside. I would sit high up in a tree to see how many guards were protecting the caravans. And then as they made camp for the night, I would creep closer to their campfire to listen to them.~
@290 = ~I listened for the contents of their caravans and the "troubles" of their simple lives. But I especially loved the stories they recalled to pass the time. It was my favorite moment, because it was my time to shine. It was my time to put my skills to good use.~
@291 = ~At one point, I remember being awoken by the sounds of hushed voices and the soft thudding of wheels on the lush grass of the dark forest. I remember groggily looking around from my perch and seeing a very well-guarded convoy.~
@292 = ~To my luck, they had stopped to rest right below the tree I was previously sleeping on. I took note of the band of five guards huddled around a single wagon with silver-lined wheels.~
@293 = ~"They must have something suspicious... or valuable," I thought to myself. And nothing excited me more than the thrill of taking something worthwhile, and the thrill of the uncertainty of being caught. But I would not have expected the outcome to turn out the way it did.~
@294 = ~Let me guess, you attempted to rob the wagon and you got caught?~ 
@295 = ~And what happened?~
@296 = ~And this is the part where I leave you with a cliffhanger.~ [QI#Mi053]
@297 = ~And before you start pouting or complaining, I have already taken up much precious time. We need to keep going.~ [QI#Mi054]
@298 = ~You can thank me later.~
@299 = ~I am ready to continue my story, if you would but take the time to listen.~ [QI#Mi055]
@300 = ~Yes, I am quite eager to know how your story turns out.~ 
@301 = ~If you make it quick, I will hear you out.~
@302 = ~I don't have time for this! I don't see a point to your story, and I don't see the point in why you must speak.~
@303 = ~To refresh your memory, I stopped at near the climax of the story. And I was delighted to see the look on your face when I refused to continue my tale.~
@304 = ~But now I will continue...~
@305 = ~Again with your demands! I begin to weary of this. But I will do as you wish for now...~
@306 = ~Then you never had any patience to begin with. And not only are you impetuous, you are a fool.~
@307 = ~At least now I know not to waste my time with you.~
@308 = ~I had recently discovered that I was blessed with the gift of magic, and as you could have guessed, I used this to my advantage.~
@309 = ~I could only do cantrips at the time, but that was all I needed. I created a flare that I shot up into the air to aid as a distraction, and a distraction I created.~
@310 = ~And?~
@311 = ~The bright, red light alarmed the guards immediately, and what I presume to be the leader of the guards, quietly motioned for about half of his group to scout the area.~ 
@312 = ~I was a small, scrawny child so I was not easily seen. I took this chance to go for the now, semi-guarded wagon. The only thing standing between my prize and me was the commander of the group and two of his guards.~
@313 = ~I had the darkness of the night on my side, but alas, what happened next shocked me.~ 
@314 = ~A volley of arrows were shot in the direction of the bushes on the other side of the wagon. It killed the two remaining guards and left the commander standing alone.~
@315 = ~Did you save him?~
@316 = ~What did you do?~
@317 = ~Ha! I was a small child, how could I have helped a man covered in heavy, loud chain mail?~
@318 = ~His enemies would have heard the clanking of his metal meters away and killed us both!~
@319 = ~I did what any smart elven child would do in my situation.~
@320 = ~In the seconds that it took to aim and fire another volley of arrows, I snuck into the arrow-covered caravan and took the smallest thing I could carry.~
@321 = ~I didn't have much time to look at what I had grabbed, but there wasn't much time for me to linger. I cradled the object close to my chest, and I rushed into the trees further and further away from the wagon.~
@322 = ~I must have been running for hours, because I didn't stop until I reached a small opening in the forest where the moon shined brightly.~
@323 = ~But you left the man to die! How can you live with yourself?~
@324 = ~That was probably a smart move on your part.~
@325 = ~I care not for the man. His duty was to protect the wagon, and he failed miserably. His punishment was death.~ [QI#Mi056]
@326 = ~I see no reasoning in helping an already dead man.~
@327 = ~All life is precious - no matter how big or small.~
@328 = ~What makes you so important compared to everyone else?~
@329 = ~I guess I can understand your reasoning.~
@330 = ~But is it really though? You walk on grass. You kill animals for their fur and meat. You slaughter the unfortunate people who get in the way of your mission.~ [QI#Mi057]
@331 = ~I take no pleasure in what I do, I do what I must.~
@332 = ~I guess I understand your reasoning.~
@333 = ~But how can one such as yourself judge my actions when death follows you wherever you go?~ [QI#Mi058]
@334 = ~I am more valuable than a commoner. I am quicker, smarter, and more beautiful... the list goes on.~
@335 = ~But I don't need to prove myself to you.~
@336 = ~I'm glad that you could see my reasoning.~
@337 = ~With that being said, here is something for you to ponder on the road.~
@338 = ~Can you really judge someone based on their actions? To you or to the next person, the definition of evil is something that you think is morally wrong.~ [QI#Mi059]
@339 = ~But imagine you have taken the place of a conqueror that has killed many people and taken many lands in order to protect his people. His people will think he is a loving and righteous ruler, while the conquered will think him a tyrant.~ [QI#Mi060]
@340 = ~Can you truly condemn someone for thinking they are doing what they think is the best for their homeland? Can you condemn me for trying to live, for trying to survive?~ [QI#Mi061]
@341 = ~I have said enough already, and you are most likely drowning with thoughts of your own. Think carefully on what I have said.~
@342 = ~And before you decide to be a pain in my rear, demons are a true source of evil.~
@343 = ~I believe I have given you enough time to think about our talks, have I not?~ [QI#Mi062]
@344 = ~No matter, I don't care for your opinions. I wanted you to see that everything in this world is not as simple as seeing black and white, and I think I have gotten my point across.~
@345 = ~Yes, what we discussed previous was certainly intriguing. It was very thought-provoking, and I appreciate such deep thought.~
@346 = ~It was interesting, but it was hardly worth any second thought.~
@347 = ~The world is in a state of black and white. That's the way it is, and that's the way it has always been.~
@348 = ~If you don't care for my opinions, then why even bother telling me something so controversial?~ 
@349 = ~Good. Then maybe you are not completely a lost cause.~
@350 = ~At least you had the mind to think on it, that's more credit than I gave you.~
@351 = ~If that is the opinion you have and will keep, then there is nothing I can do to persuade you otherwise.~
@352 = ~I have tried to put up a rather decent argument, if I do say so myself, and you refuse to see past what you believe. I probably gave you more credit than you deserved.~
@353 = ~Because you would have at least heard the idea and possibly have pondered it. But I guess it was my fault for giving you more credit than you deserved.~
@354 = ~But nonetheless, I have yet to finish my story.~ [QI#Mi063]
@355 = ~You haven't finished your story yet? Ugh, how long will this take? Please speed it up.~
@356 = ~Then please proceed. I'd like for you to finish your story.~
@357 = ~I suppose you can continue.~
@358 = ~I truly tire of hearing you ramble.~
@359 = ~Patience!~
@360 = ~Patience is the key to all knowledge that exists! Patience is the key to everything that you will learn! One does not simply look at a book and absorb its contents by quickly scannings its pages!~
@361 = ~I tire of hearing you complain. You are naught, but a fool.~
@362 = ~I thank you for your never-ending patience. It is nice to see that some people in the world have the aptitude for such things.~
@363 = ~Now where did I leave you... Ah yes, I remember now. The object I had in my hands was a very small chest, and I was about to uncover the contents of it.~
@364 = ~Of course, it had a lock and a trap, but my skills were obviously impressive enough as a youth to disarm the trap and pick the lock successfully.~
@365 = ~I'm not here to listen to you brag about yourself.~
@366 = ~Good job. Can you continue the story now?~
@367 = ~Hmm, I must admit. You are correct on that statement for once in your life. But still, I felt that you needed to be reminded of how amazing I was at such a young age.~
@368 = ~But I will do us both a favor, and I will continue.~
@369 = ~I felt that you needed to be reminded of how amazing I was at such a young age. But very well, I will continue.~
@370 = ~You can imagine the giddiness I felt when the lock on the chest clicked open. What previous jewel would be in there? What magical amulet would I find? Better yet, could there be a pile of precious metals?~
@371 = ~But what I found... no amount of words could describe how I felt at that exact moment.~
@372 = ~What was it?~
@373 = ~I found a piece of parchment.~
@374 = ~You found a piece of paper?~
@375 = ~Yes, I found "a piece of paper". It was blank when I found it too. I was so furious. I had nearly risked my life for a piece of paper, and not just that, there were other chests that I could've taken, but I had to choose this one!~
@376 = ~I crumpled the paper and threw it across the moonlit grass. I was about to turn away when I had a sudden urge to turn around.~
@377 = ~And when I did, the parchment suddenly had blue scribbles all over it. I then realized why the lock and the trap were so easily disarmed - the parchment was magically infused with power of its own. Only the moonlight... a full moon could've shown its true self. Otherwise, it would have been another parchment that someone would have most likely thrown away or written on.~
@378 = ~And what was on it?~
@379 = ~That's not something I am willing to share with you at this time.~ [QI#Mi064]
@380 = ~Perhaps another day.~ [QI#Mi065]
@381 = ~<CHARNAME>, how did you get to where you are now? As in, what inspired you to become what you are?~ [QI#Mi066]
@382 = ~The death and the loss of friends and family have lead me to this path.~
@383 = ~My search for answers to the unknowin has always inspired me to keep going.~
@384 = ~My enemies make me into who I am today, I live to kill.~
@385 = ~Nothing inspires me. I inspire myself.~
@386 = ~I am not quite sure, I honestly just go with the flow of events.~
@387 = ~Ah, something that I can relate to. I understand the wonder and amazement of drinking in valuable knowledge.~
@388 = ~That's the answer I expected from someone like you. Death seems to follow you everywhere.~
@389 = ~I suppose that is a good response to my question. It is good to be proud of your accomplishments.~
@390 = ~So I can only presume. But the flow events is so uncertain... it is almost scary to think about letting today's events influence your life for tomorrow, yet at the same time, it is exciting.~
@391 = ~Nonetheless, you and I are quite similar. We both know what it takes to achieve our ultimate goal.~ [QI#Mi067]
@392 = ~You and me are nothing alike. I don't know what you are talking about.~
@393 = ~I guess we are smimilar in some ways, but we can't be too similar to each other.~
@394 = ~I suppose we are, we are both a force to be reckoned with.~
@395 = ~No? Are you that daft you cannot see the obvious?~
@396 = ~Yes, you are correct. I am glad that you can see the obvious.~
@397 = ~You may think that I am savant, but just as you have had your struggles. I have had my share as well.~
@398 = ~Really?~
@399 = ~Can you tell me of your struggles?~ 
@400 = ~I really don't care what you have to say.~
@401 = ~I can sense your sarcasm, but fear not, I will not harm you. I am in a rather good mood today, and nothing you say will destroy that so I will tell you one such instance of my struggles.~
@402 = ~Ha! Do you think either of us has the time to recall all of my struggles? No, I will tell you only one.~
@403 = ~Then we have nothing more to talk about it. I don't speak to the dim-witted.~
@404 = ~I could never quench my thirst to understand the unknown even when I was younger.~ [QI#Mi068]
@405 = ~The parchment that I threw away in anger and then quickly picked up after I saw the blue writing... I couldn't understand it, but I had a strong, burning desire to know what was inscribed on it.~
@406 = ~After that day, I traveled to a quiet town where I had seen merchant caravans sell its inhabitants ink, paper, and books. I presumed that there must be intelligent life forces presiding in that town, and my assumptions were obviously correct. I found out that the inhabitants were mainly academics.~
@407 = ~I did not attend private tutoring sessions if that was what you were thinking. I would listen to the teachings of philosophers through the cracks of windows and when the seasons turned the grass frigid and the air crisp, I would climb to the roofs of the cottages and warm myself near their chimney while listening to the scholars teach their pupils how to read and write. And when the people would leave their classes for the day, I would sneak in and review the day's lessons by talking out loud and practicing how to write until my eyes were burdened with sleep.~
@408 = ~I don't know how many years I stayed in that village, all I know is that I took my sweet time to learn every thing I possibly could from the teachings of the scholars. Until finally, a full moon lit the night sky, and I was ready to read the enchanted parchment.~
@409 = ~Are you finally going to tell me what was on that piece of paper?~
@410 = ~Go on.~ 
@411 = ~I might tell you the gist of the contents if you would just be patience and listen!~
@412 = ~I took out the wrinkled parchment and held it under the radiance of the moon, and I waited until the familiar blue writing started to show just as it once did.~
@413 = ~And finally, it started to glow once more, and this time, I was able to read it. And this is where I learned life's greatest lesson.~
@414 = ~Knowledge is power.~ [QI#Mi069]
@415 = ~Death seems to have taken a liking to you. But keeping yourself alive is definitely a reason to carve your own path.~
@416 = ~What would you do if you had an eternity to live?~ [QI#Mi070]
@417 = ~Rule the world.~ 
@418 = ~Have a family and enjoy life with them.~
@419 = ~Travel the rest of the world, including the other planes.~
@420 = ~Look for a comfortable palce isolated from society and enjoy eternity in peace.~
@421 = ~I'm not quite sure.~
@422 = ~A notable desire. Definitely a true goal.~
@423 = ~Hmm, can you lead a normal life after all this?~
@424 = ~Yes, that is another wonderful goal.  There is so much unknown knowledge within this world and the next. You would need an eternity to learn it all.~
@425 = ~So a life of uncertainty? Admirable, but stupid at the same time.~
@426 = ~If I had an eternity to live, I would go to every plane and learn all there is to be learned about ancient magic. Anything to enhance my knowledge which will contribute to my power.~ [QI#Mi071]
@427 = ~I... I have a plan to aid me on my quest.~
@428 = ~I cannot tell you how I will achieve my goal, but I need you to trust me. Will you do that for me?~
@429 = ~Yes, I will trust you.~ 
@430 = ~Why should I trust you?~ 
@431 = ~No, you have given me no reason to trust you.~ 
@432 = ~Thank you for your trust.~ [QI#Mi072]
@433 = ~You will not regret it.~ [QI#Mi073]
@434 = ~You are right to question me, I have given you no reason to trust me.~
@435 = ~You are right, I have given you no reason to trust me.~
@436 = ~But know that if you put your faith in me, you will not regret it.~
@437 = ~Thanks for nothing.~
@438 = ~I'm sorry.~
@439 = ~I obviously have everything under control, but as a companion who proved herself helpful to your quest, I did not expect you to turn your back on me.~
@440 = ~I guess I cannot blame you for not wanting to get into family matters, but I can blame you for not aiding a comrade-in-arms.~
@441 = ~Sometimes sorries just don't cut it, <CHARNAME>.~
@442 = ~However, I believe I should explain myself for this occurence, but I want to make this clear that I am not clarifying myself for you but for myself.~
@443 = ~In truth, I thought she was dead. I did not want to bring up the past and relive any depressing moments. I blocked her out of my mind all these years, gradually forgetting I even had a sister. It came to the point where I *almost* believed I was the last living Beaurin.~
@444 = ~Had I known that she was alive, or had I even known that she was the elf that took the tome in the Crooked Crane... I do not know what I would have done.~
@445 = ~My sister made a foolish decision joining her "secret order". I do not know why she joined them, and I guess I never will since she is not alive for me to ask.~
@446 = ~However, I assume you want more than the basic information.~
@447 = ~You may have wondered how my sister and I were separated.~
@448 = ~There was a moment in time in our lives where we spotted a caravan being attacked, and the only living person protecting the cart was the guard captain.~ 
@449 = ~...She saw the situation the captain of the guards was in. She begged me to aid her, and I reluctantly gave in. Elaryn bravely shot her own volley of arrows and rushed in with her simple scimitars as the attackers came for the guard captain. As my sister charged, I hesitated. I thought she was so stupid, there was no way we could have survived that attack, and if she wanted to die at a young age, she could do whatever she wanted, but me? No, I wanted to live, and so I took my chance and fled. I never saw her after that until now... I thought she was dead.~
@450 = ~For a time, I wandered alone. I had such a guilty conscience, I had left my own kin to die, I felt like I should have convinced her to lay low with me. I eventually came to terms that she chose her own path, and I would choose my own. I would live so that the Beaurin name could live on.~
@451 = ~And here I am now, I am in a party of a band of bumbling baboons and a dead elven maiden by my feet. I have no sister, and I have no allies here.~
@452 = ~I knew you had it all under control.~ 
@453 = ~You can't blame me for not wanting to be in family business, especially how violently it escalated.~
@454 = ~The first time you helped me, I offered you my services. The second time you help me? I can offer nothing but my gratitude.~ [QI#Mi074]
@455 = ~You gratitude means nothing to me.~ 
@456 = ~And that's all I need. You're welcome.~ 
@457 = ~That's nice and all, but I'd rather that not happen again or you are on your own.~ 
@458 = ~Well, if it does, at least we know that we can handle it.~ 
@459 = ~Are you okay? Your sister...~ 
@460 = ~Ah, well, at least my services to you are handy. Otherwise, I would not be with you for this long.~
@461 = ~Hopefully I will not need to rely on you for anything else in the future.~
@462 = ~Hey, we are friends. That's what friends do for each other.~
@463 = ~Yeah, let's hope this doesn't happen again.~ 
@464 = ~Well, if it does, at least we know how to handle it.~ 
@465 = ~Understandable, but I know there is more for me to tell.~
@466 = ~Yes, that is good to know. But I know there is more for me to tell.~
@467 = ~I know that look in your eyes, you know that I yet hide more information from you, and you wonder why I have not told you about my sister, Elaryn.~
@468 = ~In truth, I thought she was dead. I did not want to bring up the past and relive any depressing moments. I had blocked her out of my mind all these years, gradually forgetting I even had a sister. It came to the point where I *almost* believed I was the last living Beaurin.~
@469 = ~Had I known that she was alive, or had I even known that she was the elf that took the tome in the Crooked Crane... I do not know what I would have done.~
@470 = ~But why did you not tell me?~ 
@471 = ~Everyone has their secrets, but I expected more from you.~ 
@472 = ~But we... *you* killed your sister.~ 
@473 = ~Are you daft? Did I not just say why I did not tell you sooner?~
@474 = ~Yes, yes, Elaryn used to say to that to me all the time.~
@475 = ~And? If I did not kill her, she would have killed me. What was I supposed to do? Lay down like an obedient dog and die willingly?~
@476 = ~Nonetheless, I will explain my actions fully to you, since I have no right to hide anymore from you. I will tell you what I know, starting from the earliest time I can recall.~
@477 = ~As you well know by now, I seek an immortal life. I seek a life filled with never-ending knowledge and travels throughout the planes. These tomes I am collecting, they are the key to my everlasting life. My desire is to become a lich.~
@478 = ~Yes, a lich. I care not for the world around me, I care only for what the world can give me, what I can learn from it.~
@479 = ~But you need not worry, I have no desire to conquer the world. The only temptation I have is to harvest knowledge from the planes - ancient and new knowledge, I require them all.~
@480 = ~But what does this have to do with your sister?~ 
@481 = ~My sister made a foolish decision joining her "secret order". I do not know why she joined them, and I guess I never will since she is not alive for me to ask.~
@482 = ~However, I assume you want more than the basic information.~
@483 = ~You may have wondered how my sister and I were separated.~
@484 = ~Do you remember when I spoke of the captain of the guard? The story in which I decided not to risk my life for his and instead, take the goods in his cart?~
@485 = ~I neglected to mention that I was not alone that night. My sister was there with me.~
@486 = ~...She saw the situation the captain of the guards was in. She begged me to aid her, and I reluctantly gave in. Elaryn bravely shot her own volley of arrows and rushed in with her simple scimitars as the attackers came for the guard captain. As my sister charged, I hesitated. I thought she was so stupid, there was no way we could have survived that attack, and if she wanted to die at a young age, she could do whatever she wanted, but me?

I eventually came to terms that she chose her own path, and I would choose my own. I would live so that the Beaurin name could live on.~
@488 = ~You left your own kin to die?! How will I know you will leave me in my time of need?~ 
@489 = ~You're a coward. Your sister is a true hero. We should have killed you instead.~ 
@490 = ~You did what you had to do to survive. You did the right thing.~
@491 = ~I will not. There is still so much to do with you, if I left now, it would be unfinished business. And there is nothing I abhor more than unfinished business.~
@492 = ~A coward? You would not run if you were a mere child? You would not flee from a scene of certain death?~
@493 = ~That's what I told myself every day.~
@494 = ~My sister... My stupid sister.~
@495 = ~I thought I had done the right thing running away, I thought she had died. If she did not die from the battle, she would have surely been sold into slavery and would die in slavery.~
@496 = ~But when I saw her, standing in front of me with the same fire in her eyes... I feel as if I made a mistake...~
@497 = ~...I think that is all for now. I don't want to think about it anymore.~
@498 = ~There is no need for you to do this alone. I am your friend, I am here for you.~
@499 = ~The more I learn about you, the more I regret my decision of letting you join me. I want you to leave and never come back. I can't stand to look at you right now.~ 
@500 = ~I don't agree with your way of thinking, but maybe in time, you will learn to see that there are other options than the ones you see.~ 
@501 = ~I did not expect you to agree with me, I only wished to tell you my point of view - my story. Perhaps there is another way to go about my life, but I guess we will not know until then, hm?~
@502 = ~You have been unexpectantly kind to me and understanding. Your patience knows no bound. I thank you.~
@503 = ~No need to thank me, we are friends.~ 
@504 = ~You're welcome, but I hope you know that we are friends, and friends help each other.~
@505 = ~I care not for your story. I find your pain simply amusing.~
@506 = ~I tell you of my past and my goal and yet you still spurn me?~
@507 = ~You waste my breath, and I am glad that you no longer require my services. Next we meet, beware of my powers. I will achieve my ultimately goal with or without you.~
@508 =  ~Yes... you are right. We are friends.~ [QI#Mi075]
@509 = ~If I am to be honest with you and to myself, I must admit that I am truly honored to be traveling with one such as yourself, and I am grateful that I have a loyal companion by my side.~ [QI#Mi076]
@510 = ~I will tell you more of myself and what awaits us after our dealings with Irenicus. But right now, your soul is at stake, and this is our top priority. All you need to know is that I will need your help again soon. I know there is a second tome, but I am not quite sure where it is.~
@511 = ~But to think, I would be friends with the greatest Bhaalspawn of our time...~ 
@512 = ~A lich?!~ 
@513 = ~This place... This place brings back memories.~
@514 = ~Are you okay? You look a little pale.~
@515 = ~Do you know this place? Have you been here before?~ 
@516 = ~Your spluttering reminds me of Aerie.~ 
@517 = ~I really don't have time for your blasts from the past.~ 
@518 = ~If there was something wrong, I would have stated it already.~
@519 = ~Let us continue on.~
@520 = ~Of course not. You think I would forget something like this any time soon?~
@521 = ~I know that stupidity is everywhere these days, but I wasn't expecting it from you at this moment.~
@522 = ~Enough chatter, let us move on.~

@555 = ~I had been studying the ruins for quite some time, and I had to thought to use my companions as fodder for the traps, but they proved more than capable of handling themselves. They were not simple folk. They were a force to be reckoned with in my eyes. Why waste their lives when they could be of so much more use to me?~

@607 = ~Fair enough.~

@633 = ~But to sate your curiousity, I take great pride in physical appearance... especially my face.~

@688 = ~But I guess I could give you the benefit of the doubt since you were intelligent enough to have me in your party.~

@706 = ~Fine, I will do ask you ask just this once. But watch your tongue lest I cast a spell to silence you.~
@707 = ~Why am I not surprised.~
@708 = ~I was an orphan. I did what I had to in order to survive.~
@709 =  ~If you really must know, I stole whatever I needed or wanted as a child. And then when I figured out that I was gifted with magic, I used it for luxuries. And as I grew into womanhood, I realized that men desired me - and I used this to my advantage.~ [QI#Mi080]
@710 = ~I also came to terms that there are things that I should let go, for example the past. There are things that should have been changed, that could have been changed, and would have been changed, but such is life.~

@712 = ~And more importantly, I like living, so there's no need to get into harm's way if I can avoid it.~ 
@713 = ~That's it?~
@714 = ~Sounds like you had a hard life.~
@715 = ~What a pitiful life you've lead. No wonder you're a pitiful person.~

@719 = ~I don't know what I was expecting.~
@720 = ~I wasn't expecting you to say anything.~
@721 = ~Hmph. Secrets are unnecessary. They will turn on you if you are not carefully wording everything you say.~
@722 = ~I thought as much. It's a wonder how you can even think sometimes, let alone lead a party.~
@723 = ~How interesting. But that could be your stupidity speaking.~
@724 = ~Anyway, we should get back to the task at hand. We have much to do, and your constant questions are starting to annoy me.~

@728 = ~Sounds like a wonderful way to live.~ 
@729 = ~Sounds like a horrible way to live.~
@730 = ~You must have lead a very different life than me.~
@731 = ~It was a spectacular way of life!~
@732 = ~Then you know nothing of life.~
@733 = ~It was good to share some of my background with you, but I am starting to wonder if you even have the stomach to lead this party.~

@744 = ~Yes, yes. Good job.~
@745 = ~Now... where is my tome?~
@746 = ~I see nothing. Nothing but dust. Another must have taken the tome.~

@756 = ~Minyae, you cannot be seriously considering this fool laying his sordid paws on you. (She can't be, right?)~
@757 = ~Of course, my elegant, beautiful lady. The sound of your luscious voice sends shivers down my spine. Oh, how I ache for you to be mine.~
@758 = ~Hm, okay. I have had my fill of flattery. Off with you now.~
@759 = ~Alas, I will have to worship my goddess from afar!~
@760 = ~With the money we spent, it had better be that way.~
@761 = ~And what would you know about what I seek? Absolutely nothing. Get out of my sight. What a waste of time and gold.~

@88888 = ~A Hidden Book

A young elven lady, by the name of Minyae, offered me her services if I helped retrieve a tome for her. Her request seems easy enough. Go inside a room, find the book, pick it up, and go. That's all there is to it... right?~

@88889 = ~A Hidden Book

Lies! As soon as we walked into the room, there was a lich! Minyae must have known what was beyond the door, she wouldn't have asked for our help otherwise. Unfortunately, according to the lich, the tome has already been taken by another. However, I should definitely keep an eye on Minyae.~

Minyae knew what was beyond the hidden door, she wouldn't have asked for our help otherwise. Fortunately for us, we already killed the lich in the room, however, Minyae's 'magnum opus' was nowhere in the room. Minyae is convinced someone has taken the tome, but if I want to make sure she causes no trouble in the party, I should definitely keep an eye on Minyae.~
