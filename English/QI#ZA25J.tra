@0 = ~Captain, after all that's happen to you - to us, what do you make of it all?~
@1 = ~I'm amazed at how powerful I've become.~
@2 = ~I'm still not quite sure what to think. This is all happening so fast.~
@3 = ~All this furthers my desire to return to a nice, luxurious bed and never travel again.~
@4 = ~After seeing so much despair and destruction in the world, I know I want to help as many people as I can.~
@5 = ~I've learned I can do whatever I want, when I want. No one can stop me.~
@6 = ~Honestly? I have no opinions on the matter.~
@7 = ~Yeah, I'll admit, it has been quite a voyage for me watching your powers grow.~
@8 = ~That's a fair response.~
@9 = ~Yeah, that does sound nice, but you can only do that for so long before getting bored of it.~
@10 = ~The call of adventure awaits, and I think you have adventuring in your blood.~
@11 = ~That's a benevolent objective.~
@12 = ~Frankly, I couldn't say the same for myself.~
@13 = ~That's what I like to hear!~
@14 = ~Really?~
@15 = ~I mean, all the power to you for not having a stance one way or the other.~
@16 = ~Don't take this the wrong way, <CHARNAME>, but I've learned to get the hell out of people's business.~
@17 = ~Yeah, sure, I'm a pirate, and I get into business by getting into people's business but traveling with someone to do their business? Fuck no, I'm out.~
@18 = ~I've learned a lot traveling with you, <CHARNAME>, I have, but it just solidifies that I don't belong on land. It feels like shit keeps getting worse and worse the more steps I take on this dirt.~
@19 = ~It's just like my mother used to say to me, "Don't go to places where you don't belong, Zakrion!"~
@20 = ~Well, that was more so directed at me going through the liquor cabinet when I was a small child.~
@21 = ~Regardless, I think my mother involuntarily forshadowed my future.~
@22 = ~You know, I don't think you've ever spoken about your mother before or, at least, you haven't said much about her to me.~
@23 = ~You seem agitated: is something wrong?~
@24 = ~I can understand that. I'd probably do the same if I was in your shoes.~
@25 = ~Actually, I do take offense to that.~
@26 = ~Yeah, there's not really much to say about my mother. As the years go by, I remember less and less about her.~
@27 = ~Thanks for understanding and not getting offended.~
@28 = ~Yeah, I didn't mean to do that. Sorry, captain.~
@29 = ~Lately, I've been thinking about my mother.~
@30 = ~It... almost scares me to say this, but I think I'm forgetting her face.~
@31 = ~I used to be able to recall her face vividly, but it's beginning to blur. Did she have a dimple when she smiled? Were there freckles splayed across her face?~
@32 = ~I don't remember.~
@33 = ~I didn't want to admit it because that would mean it's true, but I need to.~
@34 = ~What happened to your mother?~
@35 = ~I understand... Gorion's face is beginning to fade from my memory.~
@36 = ~You have to hold onto your mother's memory as much as you can.~
@37 = ~I'm sorry to hear that. We'll try to keep my mother's face and your foster father's face in our minds for as long as possible.~
@38 = ~I'm trying to, <CHARNAME>, I really am.~
@39 = ~My mother... let's make this story shorter than a halfling's height.~
@40 = ~She wasn't a bad mother by any means. I knew she loved me a lot.~
@41 = ~But, she couldn't handle my father's sailor life. She couldn't handle being alone. So she left. I haven't heard from her since.~
@42 = ~I've always wondered why she didn't take me with her, but I'm glad she didn't.~
@43 = ~Otherwise, I wouldn't have good friends by my side.~
@44 = ~That's enough reminiscing, though, let's get back to the task at hand. Who knows? Maybe, we'll get lucky and find an artist to paint the last memories I have of my mother.~

/* Friendship Talk 2 - Godhood */
@45 = ~I didn't think something so chaotic would happen in my lifetime.~
@46 = ~I also didn't think I'd be traveling with a child of Bhaal. Frankly, I didn't know about Bhaal until I started hearing rumors and the usual gossip from taverns.~
@47 = ~Any war that happened I thought I would be far enough on the seas that it wouldn't affect me. I'd just be there for the leftovers of the war, picking up expensive equipment and selling it on the black market.~
@48 = ~But in the midst of it all? Never.~
@49 = ~Growing up in a quiet place like Candlekeep, I never thought I'd be in the midst of it all either.~
@50 = ~It's exciting, though, isn't it?~
@51 = ~What's your point?~
@52 = ~I just want this all to end so I can live in peace and solitude.~
@53 = ~Yeah, and look at you now. If you ever returned to Candlekeep, the scholars would surely worship the ground you walk on.~
@54 = ~Yeah, it's exciting to be a part of history.~
@55 = ~I'd still rather be on the seas, but traveling with you has made staying on land tolerable.~
@56 = ~It's still an exciting adventure, no? We're going to be a part of history.~
@57 = ~Although, I'll admit that I'd rather be on the seas than here. It's more exciting out there or more peaceful - it's whatever you want it to be out there on the vast blue.~
@58 = ~I'm curious on how you're feeling. It sounds like there is a strong possibility that you could be the next <PRO_LADYLORD> of Murder.~
@59 = ~Wow, saying that aloud seems so surreal. Could I be walking and fighting alongside a future deity?~
@60 = ~Frankly, it would be wonderful to have a friend in a higher place. Imagine a deity smiting your enemies!~
@61 = ~That does sound very intriguing. Imagine having all that power at your disposal!~
@62 = ~I hope it doesn't come down to that; I like being a mortal.~
@63 = ~I hope that comes true; I know I can do great things as a deity.~
@64 = ~Woah, let's not get too ahead of ourselves. We don't even know what tomorrow will look like for us.~
@65 = ~We might be friends, but that doesn't mean I'm going to fight your battles for you.~
@66 = ~I'm already imagining it, <CHARNAME>. You don't have to tell me twice.~
@67 = ~But, you could be free! Do whatever you want - live any life you want!~
@68 = ~I think I'd take the deal.~
@69 = ~I know you'd do great things as a deity, <CHARNAME>. I've seen your skills in combat and your determination.~
@70 = ~Being a diety is in your nature... it's in your blood.~
@71 = ~That's fair, but it's fun to imagine. If only I had a ship and if only we could ponder about that idea together on the shit deck...~
@72 = ~That's not what I was suggesting. Well, I was, but I know you wouldn't fight every battle for me, only the important ones.~
@73 = ~In the end, I hope everything works out for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@74 = ~You deserve many things, especially for what you have had to face in your life.~
@75 = ~I really do hope for the best for you, <CHARNAME>. I really do.~
@1466 = ~Yeah, that makes sense. You've been experiencing life-threatening situations everywhere you go. It can't hurt to have some peace and quiet.~

/* Friendship Talk 3 - Saradush Talk and Family Quest */
@76 = ~<CHARNAME>...~
@77 = ~What do we do from here?~
@78 = ~We avenge everyone that died mercilessly here today.~
@79 = ~I don't know, Zakrion, I don't know...~
@80 = ~We move on. What else can we do?~
@81 = ~This... this is what it means to be a Bhaalspawn! Look at all these bodies! Look at all this death and destruction - it's beautiful.~
@82 = ~Yeah, that's a start.~
@83 = ~Same. Same... ~
@84 = ~Beautiful? You think this... this carnage is beautiful?~
@85 = ~I might've put some wool over my eyes for all the ruthless actions you've done along the way, but your words right now are too much.~
@86 = ~What about my family? What of Roe?~
@87 = ~I don't know if they escaped or not! I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!~
@88 = ~They could all be dead - all of them! And this... this is what you have to say?~
@89 = ~I don't know what to do with you, <CHARNAME>. You've shown that you have a conscious, but what you've said right now is atrocious. You are my friend, but, with those words of yours, you are not.~
@90 = ~I take my leave of you. You're no longer my captain, you're nothing to me, but I understand what you've done for me.~
@91 = ~So I will leave without conflict, but, if our paths should ever cross again, I will aim a ballista at your dark heart.~
@92 = ~But how can we move on from something like this?~
@93 = ~Do you think my family and Roe made it out alive?~
@94 = ~I'm sorry, Zakrion, but I can't answer that.~
@95 = ~I'm sure they made it out alive.~
@96 = ~Probably not, they're probably all dead.~
@97 = ~We can always hope for the best.~
@98 = ~Yeah, you're right. It's unfair for me to ask you that question.~
@99 = ~I hope so, I really hope so.~
@100 = ~I'm hoping that's not what happened, but, judging by all this wreckage, it looks like it's possible... ~
@101 = ~Yeah, you're right. If there was ever a time where I should pick up a religion, it should be now.~
@102 = ~We need to check the rubble. I need to go over all the bodies. I need to know what has happened to them!~
@103 = ~Zakrion, pull yourself together! There are so many bodies. We can't look through all of them. We need to move on from this; we can't linger here.~
@104 = ~Be my guest.~
@105 = ~Thanks. We'll be here for a while.~
@106 = ~I don't like saying this, but you're right. There are too many bodies, and I don't know how many bodies are under the rubble. We'd be here for too long... and vengeance cannot wait any longer.~
@107 = ~Let's just go before I change my mind.~

/* Friendship Talk 3.1 - Checking for Bodies */
@108 = ~Nothing. I found nothing.~
@109 = ~Maybe, they're under the rubble... ~
@110 = ~I'm sorry, this was a waste of time. Let's just go.~

/* Friendship Talk 4a - Everyone is Alive */
@111 = ~Roe! Ma!~
@112 = ~Oh, thank the gods and goddesses of this world. You all are safe. But where is your husband and my half brother?~
@113 = ~Oh, my dear son, you're well! They're well too. They went off to get some food, but they'll be back soon.~
@114 = ~That's great to hear, but how? How did you manage to escape?~
@115 = ~I thought you all had died... I searched for your... your bodies amongst the rubble.~
@116 = ~I didn't find anything, so I was hopeful, but I saw so many bodies.~
@117 = ~My dear son, I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. I'm so sorry we didn't reach out to you. We didn't know how to reach you.~
@118 = ~And, your little friend here - Roe Pumperknickle led us out. If it wasn't for her, I think we would've been amongst the bodies and the rubble of Saradush.~
@119 = ~Naaah, it was a joint effort! We couldn't have done it without each other.~
@120 = ~Your friend is too kind. She led us to safety. Even if we were able to escape, we wouldn't have lasted more than a minute on the roads. Roe protected us all along the way here.~
@121 = ~We're so grateful to her.~
@122 = ~Thank you... thank you so much, Roe.~
@123 = ~There's no need to thank me! You saved my life once upon a time, and, now, I'm just paying back the favor!~
@124 = ~Plus, it was very nice being able to talk to your family! They are very nice to talk to, an absolute joy to talk to!~
@125 = ~Still, thank you.~
@126 = ~Ma, do you need anything? Is there anything I can help with?~
@127 = ~No, Zakrion. We have our lives and the clothes on our back. We will make do with what we can here. Roe is awfully good at finding coins and trinkets too.~
@128 = ~Oh! I don't find them, I--~
@129 = ~Yeah, yeah, she's really good at finding things. That's why she was on my crew.~
@130 = ~Alright, Ma, if you need anything, anything at all. Don't hesitate to let me know.~
@131 = ~Or me!~
@132 = ~Yeah, or Roe.~
@133 = ~We'll be just fine, just take care of yourself, okay?~
@134 = ~I will, Ma, I will.~
@135 = ~<CHARNAME>, you don't now how relieved I am to know my family made it out of there alive.~
@136 = ~Such a weight has been lifted off my chest.~
@137 = ~If we hadn't stopped to search for a cure for Roe's fever... I don't think my family would be here right now.~
@138 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you so much.~

/* Friendship Talk 4b - Family is Dead */
@139 = ~Roe!~
@140 = ~You made it out alive! Do you... have you seen my mother?~
@141 = ~Zakrion! I, um... well, you see... ~
@142 = ~Roe, tell me.~
@143 = ~They... they didn't make it.~
@144 = ~We... we barely escaped the siege of Saradush, but I couldn't... I couldn't fend the ruffians off. I was still recovering from my fever, and I wasn't as quick on my feet as I usually am... ~
@145 = ~I thought maybe I could buy them enough time to escape, but it didn't matter... I was too weak, and they laughed at me as they struck me on my head. I just remember the blackness - they left me for dead.~
@146 = ~When I finally awoke, your mother... your family... they were just... dead.~
@147 = ~I'm so sorry!~
@148 = ~This... this isn't your fault. I should've been there for them. I failed them.~
@149 = ~No, no! This isn't anybody's fault but my own! Had I been stronger... had I been my normal self, they would've made it through!~
@150 = ~You've always been so hard on yourself, Roe. No, you did the best you could.~
@151 = ~Thank you for trying. You were always a great crewmate.~
@152 = ~They're dead. They're all dead.~
@153 = ~It's not your fault, Zakrion.~ 
@154 = ~I'm so sorry. I wish there was more we could've done for them.~
@155 = ~You win some, and you lose some.~
@156 = ~The sooner you get over it, the better you'll be for it.~
@157 = ~We could've done more, <CHARNAME>!~
@158 = ~We could've taken them to your Pocket Plane - they would have been safe!~
@159 = ~What about everyone else?~
@160 = ~It doesn't work like that, Zakrion.~
@161 = ~... You're right. I'm sorry.~
@162 = ~I just feel like there was more we could've done for them.~
@163 = ~Let's just go, I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@1467 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>.~

/* All Tracks (Friendship Talk 5 and Romance Talk 6) - Family Discussion */
@164 = ~<CHARNAME>, I wanted to talk about what happened with my family.~
@165 = ~Sure, go ahead.~
@166 = ~Can this wait?~
@167 = ~I'm not interested in what you have to say right now.~
@168 = ~This can't wait. I need to say this now.~
@169 = ~My family is alive because you took the time to help them.~
@170 = ~I know how urgent your quest is, but you still took the time to make sure Roe recovered from her fever. You didn't even know her, but you trusted me.~
@171 = ~Thank you so much, <CHARNAME>.~
@172 = ~You're my friend, Zakrion. That is what friends do for each other.~
@173 = ~Of course, I'm always there for those who need it.~
@174 = ~What did you expect me to do? Leave my friend to suffer? No.~
@175 = ~No need to thank me, it was nothing.~
@176 = ~You're a great person, <CHARNAME>. There needs to be more people like you in this dreary world we live in.~
@177 = ~Yeah, you're right. This is what friends do for each other.~
@178 = ~I'm grateful to have you as my captain.~
@179 = ~And as my friend.~
@180 = ~I really wished we had done more for my family, <CHARNAME>.~
@181 = ~At the bare minimum, we could've found something for Roe's fever. I feel like she would've been there for my family. It sounds like they could've made it.~
@182 = ~There was nothing we could've done for them. You know we had urgent tasks to attend to. More people would've died if we waited any longer.~ 
@183 = ~You need to stop living in the past of 'what ifs'. What is done is done.~
@184 = ~Don't blame this on me! If your family couldn't survive on their own, they deserved to die.~
@185 = ~I don't know, <CHARNAME>.~
@186 = ~I get that, but I really do think there was more we could have done. That's what's bothering me the most. We could've done *something*.~
@187 = ~Fuck off, <CHARNAME>! Not everybody was born to fight. Not everybody was born with hatred and malice in their heart like you.~
@188 = ~There are people in this world that just want to live a good, peaceful life. People who are innocent and caught between the wars of greater beings.~
@189 = ~Fighting for you, calling you my captain, no more. You don't have sympathy for the ones you've hurt along the way. You don't care for the balance of life and death.~
@190 = ~I can't have a captain like that. We're done.~
@191 = ~I don't feel too good about this.~
@192 = ~And part of me doesn't want to say that you're right about the things you've said. Maybe, maybe you're right, though.~
@193 = ~It doesn't make me feel great, but I can't change the past. All I can do is sail forward and obliterate all those who oppose us.~
@1900 = ~I love you, Zakrion, and I will always be there to support you.~
@1901 = ~And as my lover.~

/* Friendship Talk 6 - Final Talk */
@194 = ~Traveling with you, <CHARNAME>, causes a man to be full of himself.~
@195 = ~Is that supposed to be an insult?~
@196 = ~What's that supposed to mean?~ 
@197 = ~You're welcome?~
@198 = ~That's good, you should have more confidence in yourself, Zakrion.~
@199 = ~No, it's a good thing.~
@200 = ~It means you're a damn good leader, <CHARNAME>.~
@201 = ~Yeah, thanks.~
@202 = ~Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk about. My confidence.~
@203 = ~The reason why I bring this up is because I feel much more confident in my abilities.~
@204 = ~I have you to thank for that.~
@205 = ~I was not myself after those ship crashes, but traveling alongside you has given me a second wind.~
@206 = ~I feel good. I feel as if the salty, ocean breeze is hitting my face once again. It's one of the best feelings out there; frankly, it's the best feeling out there for me.~
@207 = ~I'm glad I could help revitalize your fighting spirit.~
@208 = ~Don't get too cocky now, there's still a lot left to do.~
@209 = ~That's weird. I don't recall you contributing much to this party.~
@210 = ~Yeah, it feels real good.~
@211 = ~Yes, captain!~
@212 = ~Ha! I can see you're running a rig on me now. Oh, how the tables have turned!~
@213 = ~What's about to happen to you, to us, <CHARNAME>, it's going to change our lives forever.~
@214 = ~I want you to know that you will always be my captain.~
@215 = ~No matter what happens next. I'll go down with my captain, but we won't be the ones going down.~
@216 = ~Amelyssan will pay for the murder of my family.~
@217 = ~Lead on, <CHARNAME>. It's time for the end.~

/* Known Romance Talk 1 - Suldanessellar */
@218 = ~If there was ever a place that was comparable to being on the seas, it would have to be Suldanessellar.~
@219 = ~Hearing the wind pass through the leaves of the trees sounded like the waves crashing against the ship. It was beautiful.~
@220 = ~Do you wish you could go back?~
@221 = ~It was nice to have some semblance of happiness and peace.~
@222 = ~Does this mean you've finally accepted that being on land is just as good as being on the ocean?~
@223 = ~We don't have time to daydream. We need to focus on the task at hand.~ 
@224 = ~Right, right. You're right. Let's get back to it, then.~
@225 = ~Would I like to go back to a full stomach, a comfortable bed, and no more impending danger? Yes. Absolutely.~

@232 = ~I want to take you on board a ship of mine. I want to hold you in my arms as we look into the far distance atop the shit deck.~
@233 = ~Frankly, I've been daydreaming of that idea more and more these days. It seems we don't really know what's going to happen to us. Everything is unpredictable - our lives are not guaranteed for tomorrow.~
@234 = ~Despite the chaotic nature of our lives, I hope you know that I will always be one of the surest aspects of your life.~
@235 = ~I've mentioned to you prior that leaving you behind at Baldur's Gate is the biggest regret of my life, and that was true. Every word of it.~
@236 = ~You know that, right?~
@237 = ~Of course, I do. I hope you know that I will also be one of the 'surest' aspects of your life too.~
@238 = ~You keep saying this over and over again. I get it. You don't need to keep repeating yourself.~
@239 = ~Sometimes, I forget that. Maybe, you could refresh my memory from time to time?~
@240 = ~I'm going to be honest with you, Zakrion. My feelings for you since Suldanessellar have changed. I think it's best that we stay friends.~
@241 = ~Friends. Right.~
@242 = ~Yeah, sure, I guess I could manage that... I'll just need some time to clean Buttercup's fur. Yeah.~
@243 = ~Yeah, I know the repetition isn't the greatest. I'm not a fan of it either, but I think something like this needs to be said.~
@244 = ~It seems I haven't been doing a great job of showing my love for you, then.~

@250 = ~Is this another one of your daydreaming shenanigans?~
@251 = ~Not now, Zakrion, there is so much to do, and we have so little time.~
@252 = ~Far from it.~
@253 = ~That's the entire point of this.~
@254 = ~We can go anywhere. Wherever you want. We can get far away from all this, and no one will know where we've gone.~
@255 = ~We can take a ship to Neverwinter or go to the mountains - Hazur Mountains. It just has to be some place far.~
@256 = ~Zakrion, we can't abandon the rest of the world.~ 
@257 = ~As much as I want to run away from all this with you, you know we can't do that.~
@258 = ~Even if we were to run now, they would eventually find us. We can't run away forever.~
@259 = ~You're a coward.~

@261 = ~The closer we sail to your destiny, the more people die, <CHARNAME>.~
@262 = ~Look around you: there is death everywhere we go. We can also keep sailing the seas. Those who mean us harm will have to find us on the ocean, and the ocean is vast.~

@264 = ~Running away isn't in my nature. You should know better.~
@265 = ~I can't run. We can't run. This is my destiny.~
@266 = ~Like I said, as much as I would like to leave this all behind me, us fleeing isn't feasible. They would find us sooner or later, and they will be even more powerful than before.~

@272 = ~I know we can't leave this quest. The whole world hinges on this, and you have a destiny to fulfill.~
@273 = ~I'm sorry for my outburst. I do know better.~

@283 = ~I don't want to talk about this with you right now. We can discuss it after we've dealt with the task at hand.~
@284 = ~Alright. Your wish is my command, my captain.~
@285 = ~That's a fair point. I suppose I get lost thinking about our future together.~
@286 = ~Well, this makes things difficult because I want to be wherever you are.~

@288 = ~After all that's happen to you, I can't blame you for wanting that.~
@289 = ~I like the sound of that!~
@290 = ~I want to travel with you, <CHARNAME>. I'd very much like for us to get on a ship - a ship of my own - and with a good crew, and we would travel across the world.~
@291 = ~Then, when we've had our share of the treasure and of the rest of the world, we can find a little uncharted island of our own. It would be a beautiful island, though, and name it after you.~
@292 = ~Then, we can build a house and make it any way you like. Then, maybe, we'd introduce little <CHARNAME>s and Zakrions to our home.~
@293 = ~I would teach them how to tie a knot and to sail a ship. When they're older, we can travel the world again, but, this time, our children will be at our side.~
@294 = ~I love that idea. Every bit of it.~
@295 = ~I would like a family with you, but I don't think I want to be on a ship for an extended amount of time.~

@317 = ~I'm definitely not the same Zakrion you met at Baldur's Gate, or, maybe I am to you, but I think I've changed.~
@318 = ~Yes, we all change; sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.~

@323 = ~If the person gets worse, well, then it's time for that person to walk the plank in your life.~
@324 = ~If the person is doing well enough, then all the better.~

@333 = ~How could I forget that moment?~
@334 = ~That was so long ago, I barely remember that moment... honestly, I don't think I remember it at all.~

@341 = ~I thank the gods and goddesses every day that you stumbled upon me when you did. I don't know what would've happened to me otherwise.~
@342 = ~If I didn't thank you enough already, I want to thank you again. For saving my life, not once, not twice, but thrice.~

@361 = ~Not only that, but you gave me a second chance despite my royal fuck up.~
@362 = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>. I love you so much, my <CHARNAME>. To be able to hold you in my arms, to feel your soft lips upon mine... these are the greatest treasures that I hold dearest to my heart.~
@363 = ~But that's not all you have blessed me with. You've helped me gain the self confidence I need to lead my next crew and to be the competent leader I know I can be. Granted, I still need a lot of work, but, I know in my heart of hearts, with you as my co-captain, I'll get there some day.~
@364 = ~And that's what I wanted to ask you today.~
@365 = ~<CHARNAME>, my captain, you are my greatest love. When all this is done, will you be my co-captain for my next crew? Will you be the captain of my heart? Will you marry me?~
@366 = ~Oh, Zakrion, yes! Of course, I'll marry you!~
@367 = ~I thought you'd never ask.~
@368 = ~I don't want to be be your co-captain. I don't want to travel the seas with you, and I don't want to marry you.~
@369 = ~None of that is of interest to me.~
@370 = ~I'm sorry, Zakrion, but I don't feel the same way about you.~

@401 = ~If I hadn't met you, I wouldn't have thought such beauty could exist on land.~
@402 = ~I'm glad you're with me, Zakrion.~
@403 = ~Do you think you'll revisit Suldanessellar some day?~
@404 = ~Suldanessellar is so beautiful; I would like to go back some day.~
@405 = ~It was nice to have some peace and quiet for once. I haven't had any of those days since Candlekeep.~
@406 = ~I'm glad to be here with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@407 = ~I think Suldanessellar was a once-in-lifetime thing for me.~
@408 = ~I'm not even sure if I'd be able to find my way back here, anyway. My compass didn't work around there. It would keep spinning and spinning.~
@409 = ~Why return to a place twice? When you've seen it once, will it carry the same in your heart?~
@410 = ~That's why I love the seas so much: it's always changing and, if you close your eyes, you might end up in a whole new area.~
@411 = ~I think you'd like staring out into the seas with me atop the shit deck. It's incredibly peaceful up there. You just have to watch out for the occassional bird shit landing.~

@413 = ~We can take a ship, no, we can take *my* ship to Neverwinter or to the jungles of Chult. Anywhere we'd like to go, we can get there.~
@414 = ~Your ship? You don't have a ship.~
@415 = ~That sounds lovely, I would love to travel the world with you on your ship.~
@416 = ~Sure, why not? As long as there's adventure out there, and I'm with you - let's do it.~
@417 = ~That doesn't sound appealing to me. When we were on that ship to Brynnlaw, that was enough sailing for me for a lifetime.~
@418 = ~Absolutely not! I like my feet to stay on the ground.~
@419 = ~Ha! That's wonderful news - music to my ears!~
@420 = ~Well, there's still some time for me to convince you.~
@421 = ~Thinking of Suldanessellar and of us has really got me thinking what I'd like to do when we this is all over.~
@422 = ~I can't wait to feel the salty, ocean breeze hit my face again, and it would be the best feeling in the world knowing that I have you on the ship with me.~
@423 = ~Who knows? I could teach you the ropes. You'd make a fine first mate and, eventually, my co-captain.~
@424 = ~Hmm, let's continue with your quest. The sooner we're done with it, the sooner we can start our life on the seas.~

/* Not Known Romance Talk 3 - Where would we want to go after all this? */

@485 = ~Yeah, of course. We'll revisit this when our livelihoods aren't always in peril.~
@486 = ~That's a fair point. Seeing as how I'm trying to do the same, but, sometimes, I find myself daydreaming of the future afterwards.~

@498 = ~I don't think I want a family, but I would like to travel the world with you.~

@500 = ~You're the perfect woman for me, <CHARNAME>. I am a lucky man.~

@503 = ~Then, what's the point of this, of us, if we can't align on what we want?~

@686 = ~I can give them to you at a discounted rate for saving my life, and, because as I've said, they're mostly crushed... and because if you had asked at a later date, they would surely be rotten and be entirely useless. However, I cannot deny their scarcity nowadays.~

@1403 = ~Hey!~
@1404 = ~(Before your hand can make its way to Zakrion's bottom, you can see his butt clenching quite visibly.)~

@1406 = ~You think you're going to get away with doing that?~
@1407 = ~Think again.~
@1408 = ~(His hand catches yours mid-swing and with his other hand, he gives your rump a sharp, hard slap.)~
@1409 = ~Two can play at that game.~
@1410 = ~(He awkwardly pats you on the back.)~
@1411 = ~I guess we all need a hug from time to time.~
@1412 = ~(He buries his head in your hair and takes a deep breath.)~
@1413 = ~You are intoxicating.~
@1414 = ~(He holds you tightly in the embrace.)~
@1415 = ~(He doesn't say anything, and lets the time pass.)~
@1416 = ~That smile of yours has given me so much life.~
@1417 = ~Better than salbread, and that's saying a lot.~
@1418 = ~The right insult can break anybody's spirit.~
@1419 = ~I can't wait to marry you, Zakrion.~
@1420 = ~I can't wait to marry you, too.~
@1421 = ~<CHARNAME> Dessani. It's a good full name, isn't it?~
@1422 = ~Never in a million years did I think I would marry a brilliant woman like you.~
@1423 = ~I had some questions about Roe.~
@1424 = ~Yeah, sure. What do you want to know?~

@1426 = ~How did you two meet?~
@1427 = ~You two seem to know each other well. How so?~
@1428 = ~Nothing.~
@1429 = ~She's a friend, a real good friend.~
@1430 = ~That's it?~
@1431 = ~Yeah?~
@1432 = ~You don't have any romantic feelings for her?~
@1433 = ~Sounds like someone isn't too fond of my halfling friend.~
@1434 = ~I hope you know, <CHARNAME>, I only have eyes for you.~
@1435 = ~Roe has been good to me, and I want to be good for her as well. That's all there is to it.~
@1436 = ~Frankly, I think she's cute, if that's what you're asking me.~
@1437 = ~More than anything right now, I see her as a friend. She has been good to me, and I want to be good for her as well. That's all there is to it.~

@1444 = ~It was coming from the storage room of the ship, and none of my men wanted to go into that room. They thought those shrieks came from a witch and, if she saw them, she would curse them immediately.~
@1445 = ~Witches are hardly ever aboard a merchant ship, so I took my chances... and I found a halfling girl tied up. I have no idea how she came to be tied up because it was certainly not done by my men.~
@1446 = ~Regardless, I approached her very calmly and treated her as a human being, well, a halfling being. She instantly perked up and started chatting my ear off.~
@1447 = ~I don't know how long I spent in the storage room chatting away with her, but it ended with me cutting off her fish braid to show to the men and telling her to hide until she could make her escape.~
@1448 = ~The rest is history.~
@1449 = ~Nothing, that's all.~

@1456 = ~I love you, too.~
@1457 = ~Those words escaping your lips are music to my ears.~
@1458 = ~And, I, love you.~
@1459 = ~(Play with his hair.)~
@1460 = ~(You run your hand through his dirty blonde hair, and he catches your hand in his.)~
@1461 = ~Having fun, are we?~
@1462 = ~There's a price to pay for touching a pirate's hair, and I'm unsure if you're ready to pay it.~
@1463 = ~We'll find out tonight.~
@1464 = ~(He gives you the side eye, and then, he winks playfully at you.)~
@1465 = ~My hair hasn't had a good brushing in ages. Thanks for that.~
