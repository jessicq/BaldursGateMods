/* Talk 1 - Buttercup Introduction */
@0 = ~Alright, I feel like I should be the one to start this conversation first.~
@1 = ~Sure, say what you have to say.~
@2 = ~Huh? What are you talking about?~ 
@3 = ~Oh, we're having a conversation right now.~
@4 = ~Look, I am not interested with what you have to say right now or at any time, really. Keep your mouth closed, got it?~
@5 = ~Fair enough. I wasn't hoping for the loud chatter and ear-piercing yells onboard a ship, but I was hoping for some banter.~
@6 = ~I may have jumped the ship a little earlier, but I'll explain myself.~
@7 = ~This is my good 'ole pal, Buttercup.~
@8 = ~She goes everywhere with me. Well, except that time at Baldur's Gate - a good friend of mine was taking care of her.~
@9 = ~Some wizard decided to do a little experimenting and merged a monkey and a cat together. I found her in a garden near the wizard tower eating some buttercups.~
@10 = ~I decided right then and there to call her Buttercup.~
@11 = ~That's what this conversation is about? Your feline friend... or, your primate friend?~
@12 = ~Thanks for letting me know. I was wondering about that creature that sits on your shoulder from time to time.~
@13 = ~Er, thanks for letting me know, I guess?~
@14 = ~She's both, depending on the angle you're looking at.~
@15 = ~Yeah, I thought I better introduce the two of you.~
@16 = ~I just wanted to clear the air. She won't get in the way of anything, and she's very quiet.~
@17 = ~I often wonder if her creator magically designed her that way. Clearly, I have no idea. Regardless, she won't be setting off any traps any time soon, but I can't say what will happen if she isn't fed at a proper time.~
@18 = ~Thanks for entertaining me on this one. After we spend more time traveling around together, I'm sure Buttercup will warm up to you and might even let you scoop her up.~

/* Talk 2 - Irenicus who? */
@19 = ~I've been hearing this name over and over again, and I still don't know who he is.~
@20 = ~Who is Irenicus?~
@21 = ~You've heard it over and over again, and you have the audacity to bring up that name again?~
@22 = ~I'm still trying to figure out who he is myself.~
@23 = ~I don't know who he is, and I don't need to know who he is. All I know is that I'm going to kill him when I find him.~
@24 = ~He's a powerful mage, and I think he knows something about myself that I don't.~
@25 = ~Why do you need to know?~
@26 = ~Well, that's unfortunate, to say the least.~
@27 = ~It would have been helpful to understand why this man is after you and who he is.~
@28 = ~Anyway, I don't want to get too ahead of myself.~
@29 = ~That makes sense. I don't know what he did to you, but I can only imagine.~
@30 = ~About that...~
@31 = ~Is he some type of oracle? I don't know how anyone could know you better than yourself.~
@32 = ~Unless you meant your Bhaalspawn capabilities, and you probably meant that part of you.~
@33 = ~I don't want to get too ahead of myself, though.~
@34 = ~I thought you might have wanted to talk about it. Rant about it.~
@35 = ~Whatever you do to release your frustrations and anger. Talking helps, so I'm told.~
@36 = ~Irenicus tortured me. Apparently, he wanted to unlock my 'untapped potential'.~
@37 = ~It was horrible, Zakrion. He repeatedly tested my mental and physical strength until I was almost driven to insanity. It was as if he expected a different outcome each time, but nothing happened.~
@38 = ~It's still too fresh in my mind; I don't want to talk about it. I'd rather forget about it.~
@39 = ~I don't want to discuss what happened to me with the likes of you.~ 
@40 = ~That fool tortured me, and he'll rue the day he even looked at me.~ 
@41 = ~Alright, I understand.~
@42 = ~Well, whenever you are ready to talk about it. I'm all ears.~
@43 = ~I just want you to know that you're not alone.~
@44 = ~Untapped potential?~
@45 = ~Could he be talking about a person's will to succeed in this life?~
@46 = ~No, you're not normal.~
@47 = ~Er, you know what I mean.~
@48 = ~I hear that the definition of insanity is when you do the same thing over and over again, expecting the outcome to change. It sounds like Irenicus might have been insane, or I could just be confusing insanity with determination.~
@49 = ~There I go again, thinking out loud! Heh, I know that's not what we're here for.~
@50 = ~Such confidence in your words. I envy that.~
@51 = ~I very much believe you when you say that too.~
@52 = ~I appreciate you opening up to me about this, <CHARNAME>.~
@53 = ~I know it's not the friendliest of conversations and, clearly, not the most pleasant conversation. I'm just glad we're at least comfortable sharing our thoughts, despite the short duration in which we've traveled together.~

/* Talk 3 - I've been thinking... */
@54 = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>. I've been thinking about Irenicus.~
@55 = ~And I don't mean any offense when I say this, but how are you so sure about yourself despite knowing this spellcasting lunatic is out there somewhere with your friend?~
@56 = ~Are you asking me why I am so confident in what I do?~
@57 = ~Have you not witnessed the power I possess? My confidence in myself is justified, and everyone around me should know it.~
@58 = ~Confidence is key to everything, Zakrion. It's what takes you to places, even to the places you wouldn't dare go otherwise.~
@59 = ~I have to be confident in my abilities, because if I don't - who will?~
@60 = ~Truthfully, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared to fail. Failure is always in the back of mind, but I can't let down those around me.~
@61 = ~I thought I told you I didn't want to talk about Irenicus anymore. Why can't you just drop the subject?~ 
@62 = ~Yeah, sure.~
@63 = ~Wow, those are some powerful words. You have so much conviction. You know your purpose, and it sounds like you know what to expect from others.~
@64 = ~You sound like my pops. My father. 'Confidence is key, Zak! Don't forget it!'~
@65 = ~Yeah, I can understand that. Who is going to advocate for yourself better than yourself?~
@66 = ~Yeah, that makes sense to me.~
@67 = ~Call it an ache to know or call it outright neglect for what you wanted at the time.~
@68 = ~I guess I thought maybe after some time, you would want to talk about it now.~
@69 = ~Actually, nothing has changed. I still don't want to talk about it, and I would really appreciate it, if you would drop the subject.~
@70 = ~Alright, fine. If you insist.~
@71 = ~No! How many times do I have to say that word? Drop it. Now.~
@72 = ~Thanks, I appreciate it. I think talking about it will help you too.~
@73 = ~Kill two birds with one stone, right? My curiosity and your... relief? Let's call it that.~ 
@74 = ~What makes you so confident about yourself despite all the odds seemingly stacking against you?~
@75 = ~Alright, okay, I'm sorry.~
@76 = ~I didn't realize how hard I was pushing you.~
@77 = ~The reason why I'm asking you about this is, well, I don't know how to say this another way.~
@78 = ~I've always been dealing with this but, lately, more so than ever. There are many times I wake up in a sweat because of all the events that have happened to me. My heart begins to pound rapidly, and I can't think properly for the first few minutes of the morning.~
@79 = ~A lot of the times when I'm trying to sleep, I can't. I think of every thing that has gone awry in my life.~
@80 = ~From my ship crashing... not once but twice. Both ships that I was the captain of - people who trusted me. It seems like every time I try to lead people, it ends up badly.~
@81 = ~Once again, I am the sole survivor from both crashes. My first ship crash was near the coast of Baldur's Gate, and the second time, well, it's different seeing as how my crew and I were ambushed, but it happened under my command.~
@82 = ~It's a lot to digest in such a short amount of time. It makes me wonder if I should ever go back to the seas.~
@83 = ~Go on.~
@84 = ~Can we save your pitiful mewlings for another time?~
@85 = ~Yeah, you're right. I do sound pitiful. I think I'll keep my mouth shut from now on.~
@86 = ~There's not much else for me to say right now. I'll admit, I thought it through this far, but I didn't really know how to proceed after telling you this.~
@87 = ~It's not great that a former ship captain isn't able to come up with things on the fly, isn't it? I'll work on that.~

/* Talk 4 - My doubts */
@88 = ~Sorry for ending the conversation so abruptly.~
@89 = ~I got uncomfortable talking about it. I know it's a bit ironic, seeing as how I asked you to talk about something which could have been uncomfortable for you.~
@90 = ~So, I wanted to talk about it a more, if you'd be open to listening to me.~
@91 = ~It's no problem at all. I'd like to hear more about you.~
@92 = ~Zakrion, you should know me better than that. We've traveled together before.~
@93 = ~We've traveled together before, remember? I'm still the same <CHARNAME>, more or less.~
@94 = ~Apology accepted. You may continue.~
@95 = ~I'm not interested in what you have to say.~
@96 = ~Fair enough.~
@97 = ~I'll keep my mouth shut from here on out.~
@98 = ~Thanks, I appreciate it.~
@99 = ~Yeah, I forget about that sometimes. It seems like a century has passed since I last saw you.~
@100 = ~Quite frankly, I didn't think I would see you again after I had gotten money to buy a new ship and a new crew. I would've liked to have stayed on the seas for much longer than I was, but I suppose the Fates had a different path for me to take.~
@101 = ~Well, now that the apology has been accepted and, with your blessing, I'll go ahead and try to explain myself further.~
@102 = ~Do you know that feeling when you accept a quest from some random stranger, because they think you can handle the task? Instead of feeling like you're on top of the world - because your task giver thought you were capable - your mind begins to spin out of control with an abundance of self-doubting questions.~
@103 = ~Questions like, "Can I actually do this?" Or maybe the quest giver will realize I can't do it, and, when I come back with nothing to show for it, they will shrug because, this whole time, they knew I was incapable of completing the smallest of quests.~
@104 = ~I feel like that. I feel like that a lot these days. I want to be able to get another ship and build up my crew again but after my second ship accident? At this point, I'm sure every sailor will see me as incompetent. Who would want to sail with me?~
@105 = ~Wow, talk about word vomit, and I'm not even drunk.~
@106 = ~I think what you're feeling is normal.~
@107 = ~You claim to be a ship captain yet you have so many doubts? No wonder you lost your entire crew and ship twice.~
@108 = ~I didn't realize you felt so strongly. I wish you had told me sooner.~
@109 = ~Your lack of confidence isn't good. You need to have confidence in yourself to lead.~
@110 = ~Is it, though?~
@111 = ~There's a lot of things that don't get under my skin, but that... what you said. Ouch.~
@112 = ~Would telling you how I felt sooner change anything? I don't think so.~
@113 = ~Yeah, I know, but how can I get back that confidence when, every time I get back on a ship, its entire crew gets massacred and the ship is utterly destroyed?~
@114 = ~I am... was a former ship captain!~
@115 = ~Before Baldur's Gate, I was known as the one of the youngest captains in the sea! I was considered the boot of all captains, but I led my crew through the toughest of voyages.~
@116 = ~You know what the most pathetic thing about it all is?~
@117 = ~This unshakeable feeling that I'm not enough, no matter how much I throw myself at it. It's not enough.~
@118 = ~I know I'm the one who started this conversation, but I'm going to end it now. I need some time to blow off some steam.~

/* Talk 5 - Feels like I keep apologizing to you. */
@119 = ~<CHARNAME>, wait. I need to apologize for my outburst from earlier.~
@120 = ~Heh, feels like I just keep apologizing to you. I know it must be tiring, especially with every thing going on. There are more important matters than listening to me prattle on about self-doubt.~
@121 = ~It's okay, I understand. Like you said, sometimes, we just need someone to talk to.~
@122 = ~Apology accepted. Again. Try not to let it happen again, okay? My patience only goes so far.~ 
@123 = ~I'll think about accepting your apology.~
@124 = ~I've had enough of your continuous whines and groans about your incompetence. Truth be told, you are the definition of incompetence.~
@125 = ~Point taken.~
@126 = ~You know, as a leader, I would've thought you would be a little bit more understanding to your crew mates, but it seems that I am drastically wrong about that.~
@127 = ~Do I want to be led by a tyrant? Not in particular, but I also need the money so I'll stick with you for now.~
@128 = ~Just don't consider me one of your pals when you need it most. Trust me, I won't be there.~
@129 = ~Heh, using my own words against me? I like it.~
@130 = ~Yeah, I understand. I'll try not to let myself slip like that again around you.~
@131 = ~Well, that's as much as I could hope for.~
@132 = ~Your patience is duly noted, and I promise you'll get something out of it in the end. I don't know what yet, but you will, one way or the other.~
@133 = ~You know a lot about me already, <CHARNAME>. You know of how my father was murdered, you know how I crashed my first ship, and you saved me from wandering around aimlessly in the middle of nowhere.~
@134 = ~Most importantly, you knew I was... am a pirate. I'm just not the captain part, because I don't have a ship nor a crew.~
@135 = ~A lot of things have changed since we last spoke, and, frankly, I'm glad we aren't starting on a blank slate, but I think there are a few things that you still might have questions about.~
@136 = ~As with all things, we both know we need to be a functional crew. In order for us to do that, we need to be open to each other like we once were.~
@137 = ~You're right. Communication is key, isn't it?~
@138 = ~It would be great to get back to where we once were.~
@139 = ~I have no desire in being open with you. I would rather keep to myself.~ 
@140 = ~Yeah, I can understand that. There's strength in keeping to yourself, but I will always believe the crew works best when we all recognize we're in this together.~
@141 = ~I guess this is where the communication ends. Hopefully, it still ends well.~
@142 = ~I'm glad we're both on the same page, <CHARNAME>.~
@143 = ~It will be like the good old days except, now, the world knows you're a Bhaalspawn. That doesn't seem too daunting, does it?~
@144 = ~Who am I kidding? It's shit.~
@145 = ~There's a lot about me you don't know about, but I want to let you know that from here on out, I'll tell you what you want to know.~
@146 = ~Communication is another key to the great mystery that is life.~
@147 = ~And for us to be a working crew, you need to know that you can trust me and vice versa.~
@148 = ~You're right about that - communication is key.~
@149 = ~Yes, I would like to get to a point where we can both be open to each other.~
@150 = ~I don't see this crew working very well, but, if that's what you want - you're the ship captain.~
@151 = ~This is going to be a great crew, mainly because I'm not at its helm this time.~
@152 = ~Well, if you have any questions, captain, don't worry, I won't run a rig on you. I'll be honest, I swear.~

/* Talk 6 - What does being a Bhaalspawn mean to you? */
@153 = ~I've talked your ear off about myself. I'm sure that can get boring, especially when you are captain of the crew.~
@154 = ~I've been meaning to ask you: what does being a Bhaalspawn mean to you?~
@155 = ~I hate it with every fiber of my being. I was not asked to be born a Bhaalspawn.~
@156 = ~It means that my power is limitless. I am the spawn of a god - the Lord of Murder. Who knows what I'm capable of?~
@157 = ~I don't know how to feel about it.~
@158 = ~I'm still trying to figure out what it means to me. I suppose it means a lot of judgment from others.~ 
@159 = ~I've come to terms with it. It's who I am, and nothing can change that. I can only change the present.~
@160 = ~It means I have the capability of shutting you up permanently whenever I want to, if you continue to yap away.~
@161 = ~I was wondering when Bhaal's violent tendencies would start to show.~
@162 = ~Sure, sure, captain. I'll stop yapping my mouth, and keep a look out for the beacons.~
@163 = ~Yeah, I can understand that. You've been thrust into a role that you had no wish in partaking.~
@164 = ~Good point. Who knows what you're capable of with Bhaal's blood flowing through your veins.~
@165 = ~There isn't always an answer to everything. Besides, I always believed how someone feels about a certain something is always the hardest to discern.~
@166 = ~People struggle with it every day. I know I do, that's for sure.~
@167 = ~Fuck everybody else. You know what you're doing, and your actions will show to the onlookers who you are and what you're capable of.~
@168 = ~Yeah, that's the best anyone could hope for, I think. To accept and understand yourself, it's a powerful thing that many people still struggle with.~
@169 = ~If there's one thing I've learned about the general mass, it's that not everyone has an 'on' switch for success within themselves.~
@170 = ~I've seen some of my peers give their all into becoming something or someone. Unfortunately, more than half of them fail. They end up aimless, sometimes delusional in their skills, but not much further than where they first began.~ 
@171 = ~Then, there are some people who can hone in on the task at hand. By sheer willpower, these people make it happen - whatever it is.~
@172 = ~There are certainly late bloomers and early bloomers, and, of course, the normal bloomers. I just don't think all people can make themselves work with their surroundings or make their dreams become a reality.~
@173 = ~I think you're wrong about that - I think everyone has the ability to succeed.~
@174 = ~I think you might be right about that. Not everyone is born to succeed.~ 
@175 = ~You're not considering all the factors in order for someone to succeed. You need to think about the environment, their wealth, who they are... there are so many factors.~ 
@176 = ~You're more than welcome to have a different opinion than me, but, then, how can you explain the beggar on the street?~
@177 = ~I'm sure that beggar had dreams. I'm sure they tried. Yet, here they are, on the streets asking - no, begging for coins from random passerbys.~
@178 = ~I suppose you do have a point.~
@179 = ~That's a harsh way of thinking. I still stand by what I said.~
@180 = ~I don't have an opinion on this matter.~
@181 = ~Fair enough. I don't expect everyone I meet to agree with me on my opinions. Otherwise, it would be very boring.~
@182 = ~I'm glad you see it my way. Preaching to the choir makes things much easier to explain.~
@183 = ~I think factors play a part for the velocity of a person's success, but I've seen noble children grow up in the world and do absolutely nothing with their lives.~
@184 = ~I've seen them talk about a grandiose plan to become a ship captain, a leader of a merchant guild, or the most renown adventurer in all of Toril. Usually, more so the latter than anything, and they all end in death. A tragedy, really, but what did you expect?~
@185 = ~That in itself is an opinion.~
@186 = ~But you, <CHARNAME>, you're on a whole different level than everyone else.~
@187 = ~When responsibilities were thrust upon you, you took the challenge - regardless of how you felt about it at the time. You knew you needed to succeed, and you made it happen.~
@188 = ~You make things happen, <CHARNAME>.~
@189 = ~I don't know how you're able to just turn on that switch. I'm just grateful I get to witness it firsthand.~
@190 = ~Maybe I'll learn a thing or two from watching the best.~

/* Talk 7 - Maybe you should consider getting yourself a Buttercup*/
@191 = ~You know, I think it would do you some good if you had a Buttercup in your life.~
@192 = ~Huh? What brought this on?~
@193 = ~With the life I lead? It's not safe for anyone to be with me.~
@194 = ~You know, maybe you're right.~
@195 = ~No, I don't think that would be great idea.~
@196 = ~I love that idea! Where could I get a Buttercup?~
@197 = ~I don't want to take care of a smelly, useless creature!~
@198 = ~It's not a secret that you have night terrors. I think having a little critter would help to calm your nerves. It's the comfort of another being nearby.~
@199 = ~Ha! Yeah, you do lead a dangerous lifestyle, but that shouldn't stop you from adopting little critters along the way!~
@200 = ~I like your enthusiasm! Unfortunately, Buttercup is one of a kind so you won't be able to get another one of her.~
@201 = ~Why not? After all the fighting and then kicking up your legs by a nice fireplace, wouldn't you like a pal to talk to?~
@202 = ~Smelly? Buttercup is hardly smelly. She always makes sure her paws and fur are pristine. And useless? Maybe she's not the best in combat, but, after the fighting, she provides comfort.~
@203 = ~I don't really know what critter would suit you. Dogs, birds, fish, and cats are too plain for you.~
@204 = ~I'm still not understanding why we are having a conversation about this...~
@205 = ~What are you going on about? Did you take too many blows to the head?~
@206 = ~Can you please elaborate?~
@207 = ~Even if I did take one too many blows to the head, I wouldn't know.~
@208 = ~I guess the reason why I'm saying all this is because of your nightmares and your internal struggles.~
@209 = ~I've been awoken by your shouts more than I'd like to say. I know it's not something you can control, but I know whenever I've gone through a tough time, I had someone there for me.~
@210 = ~That someone for me was my former first mate - the old salt, Pentos. He taught me so much after my father's death, and I look up to the man; he's inspirational.~
@211 = ~He's a family man though, so he eventually returned to his family. It was quite rough for me for a while, but, as Lady Luck would have it, I stumbled upon this pretty lady here.~
@212 = ~*Mrrrrrrow.*~
@213 = ~Yes, Buttercup, that would be you.~
@214 = ~What I'm trying to say, and - I think I'm doing a poor job of saying it - is that I think you need a friend.~
@215 = ~Who says I don't have friends?~
@216 = ~That's rude of you to make that assumption.~
@217 = ~That's a good point. Where would one go about finding a 'friend'?~
@218 = ~I prefer to keep to myself. I don't want to burden others with my problems.~
@219 = ~I don't need friends. The only person I can depend on is myself.~
@220 = ~Heh, I didn't mean it in that way.~
@221 = ~I'm sure if we head to the Docks district in Athkatla, there would be one or two nice ladies there that would like to listen to what you have to say, provided you have the coin.~
@222 = ~I'm here for you too, captain, and I'm free of charge.~
@223 = ~That's considerate of you, but keeping all your problems to yourself is a really heavy burden to bear. It's nice to share the load from time to time.~
@224 = ~Whatever you say, captain.~
@225 = ~Maybe you don't need a Buttercup, maybe you don't want to share your burdens. That's all fine and dandy, but, captain, I hope you know you can always speak to me.~

/* Talk 8 - I'm seeing you accomplish so much. */
@226 = ~If there is one thing that always makes a great captain, it's the amount of accomplishments achieved in such a short manner of time.~
@227 = ~And you, my captain, have accomplished so much. Do I agree with everything you've done? Of course not, but it's not my place to make your decisions for you.~
@228 = ~Thanks, Zakrion. I feel like I've accomplished quite a bit since I first started adventuring.~
@229 = ~That's not a good way to measure someone's 'greatness'.~
@230 = ~I already knew that, but thanks for reminding me.~
@231 = ~I don't care for your opinions. All I care about is that I'm getting places with my actions, and people are noticing me.~
@232 = ~Really? I didn't think I was doing too much...~
@233 = ~You have! I feel like a reborn man every time I witness another task accomplished by you!~
@234 = ~That's how I measured greatness in myself. Otherwise, I don't think I would've gotten as far as I did without my measurements.~
@235 = ~I like the attitude! You know your worth and your potential!~
@236 = ~Sure, sure, my opinions don't mean much to you. I can get behind that, but the fact of the matter is that you're making waves wherever you go.~
@237 = ~Give yourself some credit, <PRO_MANWOMAN>! People all over Sword Coast know that you defeated Sarevok, and, now, here you are in Athkatla!~
@238 = ~I used to think I was the special one. My father would always tell me how intelligent and strong I was. I felt invincible in his presence.~
@239 = ~I won't lie, I thought I was pretty much invincible up until my first ship crash. I was badly shaken up, but I didn't want that to deter me.~
@240 = ~Traveling with you during those times helped me believe I was invincible again.~
@241 = ~We found out who was responsible for the iron shortage in the Nashkel Mines, and we stopped a war from happening between Baldur's Gate and Amn!~
@242 = ~How many times do you get to do that in a lifetime?~
@243 = ~It was a great time traveling with you despite my situation and the previous events leading up to it.~
@244 = ~After my first ship crash, I don't know how I was able to pull through it, but I reached an inn on my own.~
@245 = ~I think I slept for days, because the innkeeper charged me triple for my stay, heh.~
@246 = ~And you can bet your ass I was three sheets to the wind for a couple days afterwards... at a different inn. I got kicked out of the first inn.~
@247 = ~Despite all that happened to me, I was able to find my way through the wilderness, and make it out in one piece.~
@248 = ~On top of that, I was able to gather a crew and steal, uh, borrow a ship.~
@249 = ~I was going to return it when I had a ship of my own! Actually, no. No, I wasn't. No point in running a rig on you there, captain.~
@250 = ~Damn, I have a habit of getting side-tracked nowadays.~
@251 = ~I'm trying to say it's easy to admire your success, <CHARNAME>.~
@252 = ~You really do seem invincible.~
@253 = ~Of course, I'm invincible. I am a Bhaalspawn. I have so much power at my fingertips, and it's just going to keep growing.~
@254 = ~I don't feel that way.~
@255 = ~Well, when you're as brilliant as I am, there's nothing that will get in your way.~
@256 = ~Maybe I am, but all I'm trying to do is survive.~
@257 = ~I am not invincible by any means. Irenicus showed me that.~
@258 = ~I guess the moral of the story here is that I should be a demigod.~
@259 = ~No? If I was you, I would feel on top of this world! I would have not just a simple ship but a man-o-war. Not one man-o-war either but as far as the horizon goes.~
@260 = ~Surviving. Aren't we all trying to survive in this world?~
@261 = ~You really should give yourself more credit though. You are doing much more than just surviving.~
@262 = ~Right. Yeah, the torture - how could I have forgotten?~
@263 = ~But you survived.~
@264 = ~One day, I'm going to get back what I've lost. Every ship on the seas will know my name.~
@265 = ~One day.~

/* Talk 9 - I guess I never told you about how I got captured, huh? */
@266 = ~I don't think I told you about how I was captured by those pirates at the Sea's Bounty Tavern. I'd like to share that with you.~
@267 = ~Sure, I'd like to hear about it.~
@268 = ~If it's an uncomfortable subject for you, you don't need to tell me about it.~
@269 = ~I don't care how you got captured, and I don't care to hear about what you have to say.~
@270 = ~That's disappointing to hear.~
@271 = ~But, yeah, I get it. Can't say I won't be hanging a jib for a while, but, at the end of the day, you're the captain.~
@272 = ~I've learned that you need to talk about the things that are the most uncomfortable to you. If you don't, you'll harbor so many negative thoughts that you'll eventually regret saying or doing something you didn't mean to say or do.~
@273 = ~If anything, this is quite embarrassing for me to say.~
@1416 = ~Right... let's just tell anyone that asks I was drunk, and my lips run loose when I'm heavily intoxicated.~
@274 = ~As you might know already, my father was murdered right before my eyes... and if you didn't know, well, now you do.~
@275 = ~I was lily-livered, and I didn't do anything to save my father from death. I'll spare you the details, but what little of the crew we had left after the pirates boarded my father's ship fled with me.~
@276 = ~We initially lost my father's ship, but one of my father's men refused to let it go... that old seadog, heh. He concocted a plan to overtake the ship at nightfall. It was a brilliant plan, and I remember wishing I had the intelligence to come up with the plan. Or, at least, I wish I had the courage to lead the charge.~
@277 = ~That old seadog led us to victory that night, and we recaptured my father's ship. Unfortunately, he was one of the casualities, but his death was heroic and one that could be found in fairy tales.~
@278 = ~It's a pity that he won't ever have a story written about him... it makes me wonder how many unsung heroes we have. I don't want to be like that, <CHARNAME>. I want to be remembered.~
@279 = ~I don't think life is about 'being remembered' or 'making history'. You should live for yourself.~
@280 = ~I understand that. I want that for myself too.~
@281 = ~Being remembered isn't a priority of mine. I just want to live a simple life. Honestly, I would rather be forgotten and lost to time.~ 
@282 = ~Ha! The only person that would ever remembered you would have been your father, and, unfortunately for you, he's dead.~
@283 = ~I don't think you get it, <CHARNAME>. This is something I want to strive for. This is something I want for myself.~
@284 = ~I am living for myself.~
@285 = ~You have nothing to worry about, I can tell you that!~
@286 = ~I can understand that way of thinking, but, I'll be honest, I'm a bit baffled by it. What's the point of living, if you're not here for a purpose? Is life really just... aimless?~
@287 = ~Don't we all have something to live for?~
@288 = ~While I do appreciate the occassional morbid jokes every now and then, I'd rather you not talk about my father like that.~
@289 = ~Anyway, to get back to the reason why I started this entire conversation with you...~
@290 = ~I like to think I'm not a vengeful man, but, when certain circumstances happen to you, you need to take action.~
@291 = ~My father's murder won't go unanswered. I will find the pirate that made him walk the plank, and he will regret it.~
@292 = ~I'll get to kill two birds with one stone: I will avenge my father's death, and I will be known as the slayer of the Pirate Lord Desharik.~
@293 = ~It sounds like you're looking for fame, more so than avenging your father's death.~
@294 = ~And I will be here to support you in your endeavors.~
@295 = ~So what does this have to do with you getting captured?~
@296 = ~That sounds stupid. You should shoot for a higher goal; you should shoot for being the next Pirate Lord. What about Pirate Lord Dessani?~
@297 = ~I don't approve of any type of revenge. I think you should take a higher path.~
@298 = ~Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. What does it matter? I'll be doing right by my old man.~
@299 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. It means a lot to me that I have the support of my captain.~
@300 = ~Pirate Lord Dessani? I can't say I don't like the sound of that!~
@301 = ~Take a higher path? Since when did taking a higher path do any good for pirates? Sooner or later, someone in some part of the world is out for your head.~
@302 = ~Might as well give them a reason to put a bounty on you.~
@303 = ~Well, I was caught by some of Desharik's men, or I should say I was betrayed by my own crew.~
@304 = ~I guess it wasn't a secret that someone was out for Desharik's blood, and it didn't help that I wasn't quiet about it.~
@305 = ~What I didn't account for was the amount of support from the Pirate Lord's men. Maybe support isn't the right word for this, but you get my meaning.~
@306 = ~I don't want to go into the details of my incompetency that day, but my nerves got the better of me. Next thing I knew, I was in that shit hole.~
@307 = ~So, yeah, thanks again for saving my hide.~
@308 = ~Let's not make it a common occurrence.~
@309 = ~No worries. It's just another day of saving people for me.~
@310 = ~It's whatever. You don't owe me anything.~
@311 = ~You're welcome.~
@312 = ~That's not my plan.~
@313 = ~Yeah. Hopefully, I won't need my ass to be saved again.~
@314 = ~If you say so.~
@315 = ~Thanks for listening, <CHARNAME>. You're a damn good captain of listening, and, of course, leading the crew.~


/* Talk 10 - So, care to tell me what you've been up to since Baldur's Gate? */
@316 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME>, what did you do during your break?~
@317 = ~Ah, maybe that's a bad way of putting it. What were you up to before ending up in Athkatla?~
@318 = ~I was training every chance I could get. Something always happens when you least expect it.~
@319 = ~I stopped the crusade led by Caelar Argent to invade Avernus.~ 
@320 = ~You know me. I was relaxing with some fine wine and a good book.~
@321 = ~It's none of your business.~
@322 = ~I spent my time traveling and understanding different cultures.~
@323 = ~After the events in Baldur's Gate, all I wanted to do was relax.~
@324 = ~I spent my time communing with nature and her inhabitants.~
@325 = ~Apparently, all that training didn't do you any good.~
@326 = ~Er, seeing as how you were still captured by Irenicus. That's what I meant.~
@327 = ~You stopped a what?! A crusade to Avernus?~
@328 = ~I always miss out on all these events when I'm out on the seas. Well, maybe it was a good thing I wasn't caught up with a crusade to Avernus.~
@329 = ~Change that wine to an ale, and I would join you on that.~
@330 = ~Yeah, you're right. It is none of my business.~
@331 = ~You spent all that time traveling, and Irenicus was still able to find you? Damn. If I ever need a bounty hunter, I know who I'm going to ask for.~
@332 = ~Sorry, bad joke.~
@333 = ~I can't blame you there. One of my favorite things to do after a long, hard voyage is to sleep for days on end.~
@334 = ~You spent time in the woods, and Irenicus was still able to find you? Damn, he's better than any hunting dog I've ever seen.~
@335 = ~It seems that no matter what you do, you're destined to be in some type of danger.~
@336 = ~It doesn't seem like the waves you're riding are going to get any easier, too.~
@337 = ~This may seem like an odd question, but do you remember how we departed? The exact details have been washed away from my brain.~
@338 = ~I'm surprised you don't remember. We were good friends after all.~ 
@339 = ~We didn't talk too much. We were merely traveling companions.~
@340 = ~So little time has passed, but I feel like it has been a lifetime. I don't remember the details either.~
@341 = ~Well, you ended our relationship or whatever it was. No hard feelings, though.~ 
@342 = ~Hmph. We were romantically involved, and, then, you decided it wasn't a good idea anymore.~
@343 = ~I didn't forget about our frienship, <CHARNAME>. I was just wondering how we left things off, but it seems like we departed in good terms. I'm glad to hear that.~
@344 = ~And look at us now! Here I am talking to you, and you are talking back to me. That's an improvement from prior.~
@345 = ~That's alright. I can't expect you to remember the details, if I can't remember them myself.~
@346 = ~Oh. Right.~
@347 = ~I don't know if you'll believe me now, but I did have feelings for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@348 = ~To be frank, I didn't think I would see you after Sarevok, and I thought it would be best to end it there. A life on the seas is not a life many people choose, especially a life with a pirate.~
@349 = ~Go on.~
@350 = ~I thought you could only have one love and that love was the sea?~
@351 = ~You broke my heart, Zakrion. I'm not sure if I will ever be able to forgive you for that.~
@352 = ~I would be lying if I said I never thought of you while I was on my ship.~
@353 = ~Seeing you again has reminded me of how I felt about you, and it only confirms that my feelings for you were real.~
@354 = ~Knowing what Irenicus did to you... I feel ashamed of myself. Maybe this could have all been averted if I had just let our relationship take its course.~
@355 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm sorry. I don't know if you're willing to give me... us another try, but you have my sailor's pledge: I will let our relationship run its course.~
@356 = ~Your sailor's pledge doesn't mean anything to me. You broke my heart, and I'm not willing to risk it again.~
@357 = ~I still haven't completely forgiven you for what you've done, but I do want us to stay friends.~
@358 = ~I accept your apology, Zakrion, but I would like for us to remain friends.~
@359 = ~I accept your apology, Zakrion, and I would like to give our relationship another try.~
@360 = ~I will take you back, if you promise you'll never break my heart again!~
@361 = ~I'll give our relationship another try, but you have a lot to make up for.~
@362 = ~Yeah... I can understand that. I appreciate your candor, too.~
@363 = ~I will not be your lover, but I will stand by you as a friend. A friend that you can trust.~
@364 = ~You... you will?~
@365 = ~I can hardly believe my luck! <CHARNAME>, I swear to you; I will prove to you that I am worthy of standing at your side.~
@366 = ~Thank you for giving me this opportunity to make amends. I don't know if it will be enough, but at least I can say I gave it my all.~
@367 = ~Yeah, I genuinely thought that was true. Don't get me wrong, I love the sea. I will always love the sea, but...~
@368 = ~Yeah, things could have been handled better, but...~
@369 = ~This may seem like an odd question, but, as one of your crew mates, I want to clarify my position with you. What do you think of me?~
@370 = ~I consider you a friend, Zakrion.~
@371 = ~You're good at holding your own in combat, you have a decent sense of humor, but your cooking is terrible.~
@372 = ~I don't really have an opinion of you.~
@373 = ~Are you trying to fish for a compliment? If you are, you aren't getting anything from me.~
@374 = ~You're quite shit. You talk a lot, and you have nothing to show for it.~
@375 = ~I think you're a good friend, Zakrion, but I am beginning to think of you as more than just a friend.~ 
@376 = ~You're a strong, thoughtful, and attractive man, Zakrion. I'd like to get to know you better, if you catch my meaning.~
@377 = ~Wow, alright. I wasn't expecting that.~
@378 = ~Not sure how to feel about that, but I will say I don't have much to say to you anymore. I guess I know where I stand.~
@379 = ~Ha! Can't say you're wrong there. I'll take your feedback into consideration, captain. I'll improve on that - who knows?~
@380 = ~After all this time?~
@381 = ~I guess there has been a lot on your mind, but I expected more than that from you. At least I know where I stand in your eyes.~
@382 = ~What's wrong with fishing for compliments?~
@383 = ~All jokes aside, the question was serious.~
@384 = ~Oh.~
@385 = ~I wasn't expecting that, but I'd be lying if I said if I didn't have any feelings for you.~
@386 = ~You're a remarkable and intriguing woman, <CHARNAME>. I would very much like to see where this goes with you.~
@387 = ~We'll talk about this some more, captain. Don't worry, I won't leave you high and dry.~
@388 = ~I guess I got more than what I was initially looking for, and I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@389 = ~Thanks for letting me know your thoughts on me, <CHARNAME>.~
@390 = ~It has been enlightening for me, to say the least. Thanks for entertaining me.~


/* Talk 11 - Daydreaming */
@391 = ~It seems much more appropriate to daydream on the shit deck than on the road.~
@392 = ~At least on the shit deck, I could see the vast, endless blue. Here, I just see dirt, pebbles, prostitutes, and the occassional robbery. I can't say I'd prefer the soil that I stand on when I could have the salty breeze on my skin.~
@393 = ~What were you daydreaming about?~
@394 = ~If only you could go back to the sea... oh wait, you can't, because you don't have a ship!~
@395 = ~The shit deck?~
@396 = ~Why are you daydreaming? We could be ambushed at any minute!~
@397 = ~Again? What more do you have to say?~
@398 = ~Sometimes, <CHARNAME>, sometimes... your words make me want to walk the plank.~
@399 = ~But you have a mean sense of humor; I can't say I appreciate it all the time but most of the time.~
@400 = ~It almost breaks me out of my daydreams, but the imagery flowing in my brain...~
@401 = ~Yeah, the shit deck.~
@402 = ~It's the tallest portion on the ship. A fellow sailor would scramble to the shit deck, squat at the top, and let their shits plop onto the sailors below.~
@403 = ~I'm kidding, really.~
@404 = ~The shit deck is where a sailor would go to scan our surroundings, but, since it's the tallest part of the ship, seagulls and other sea birds do tend to shit on it more often than any other area on the ship.~
@405 = ~It's also the best place to daydream...~
@406 = ~Maybe, but there's always a risk, isn't there?~
@407 = ~Besides, I don't think you could fault me for the imagery flowing in my brain...~
@408 = ~Well, let me tell you.~
@409 = ~Endless salbread. My tankard filled with the finest rum. Steamed singing fish, fried trout, and the musky smell of fried hogfish... all laid out on a long banquet table with a cornucopia of exotic fruits.~
@410 = ~That's what I'm daydreaming about.~
@411 = ~That sounds absolutely lovely.~
@412 = ~Stop. You're making me hungry.~
@413 = ~I'd much prefer other foods, but a banquet of food does sound quite nice.~
@414 = ~I don't eat. Or drink.~
@415 = ~There's no room for idle thinking, Zakrion. Get it together.~
@416 = ~Yeah, it does.~
@417 = ~Ha! Maybe we should stop by an inn then!~
@418 = ~When doesn't a banquet of food not sound nice?~
@419 = ~Yeah, sure, and I don't shit out of my ass.~
@420 = ~Right. Right. We have many important tasks to do. I get it.~
@421 = ~Let's go.~
@422 = ~Honestly, <CHARNAME>, daydreaming about salbread, fish, and rum isn't what I wanted to talk to you about.~
@423 = ~Far from it, actually.~
@424 = ~I constantly ask myself: do I deserve to be here? I look around me, and I see seasoned travelers. Experts of their craft.~
@425 = ~Then, I see you. A powerhouse.~
@426 = ~Sure, I might seem confident on the outside, I have to be, you know? I used to be a ship captain - a pirate captain. Any visible weakness could be seen as incompetent or unfit to lead.~
@427 = ~I was lucky with my father's ship... the pirates onboard his ship were loyal to him, but it felt like they were only loyal to me because of their goodwill towards my father. Take a look at what their trust got themselves into. Their bodies are floating around somewhere in the vast ocean - no one is going to give them a true burial, only a watery, restless burial. The ocean is a graveyard, but it's a graveyard without tombstones.~
@428 = ~And the other ship after Baldur's Gate? Well, what can money not give you? The loyalty of my former crew mates came from the coin in my pocket. What have I actually done in this life, other than lead many, many men to their deaths?~
@429 = ~I don't know, Zakrion. That is something for you to figure out as you live your life and experience the world.~
@430 = ~You make a good point. What have you done? I mean, you haven't been doing much for this party.~
@431 = ~It's alright to feel like that. Nobody is perfect, and we all make mistakes.~
@432 = ~I understand your feelings, but I don't have an answer to give you.~
@433 = ~It sounds like you need to do a lot of self-reflecting.~
@434 = ~I think you've contributed to this group a lot. You shouldn't be so hard on yourself.~
@435 = ~Yeah, I figured that would be your answer.~
@436 = ~Ouch. Well, I did bring this upon myself so I can't really say anything to defend myself.~
@437 = ~Yeah, I know the 'we learn from our mistakes', but when does a mistake cost too much? Is it worth learning from the mistake, when good lives are lost?~
@438 = ~You're obligated to say that as the captain of this crew. It would reduce the morale, otherwise.~
@439 = ~I don't know, I just wish there was some way to know what I've contributed to the people around me.~
@440 = ~Maybe it would help me feel better about everything that has gone on in my life?~
@441 = ~That's enough about that. I hope I will be of use to you in the near future. I hope I can prove my worth to you... and to myself. Then, we'll celebrate with a banquet.~

/* Romance Talk 1 - I still can't believe I'm here with you */
@442 = ~I still can't believe I'm here with you.~
@443 = ~Part of me thinks this is a dream, and I'm still being tortured by those pirates below in that inn.~
@444 = ~At any moment, I'm going to wake up from it and realize that there's shit all around my feet, and I'm going to walk the plank.~
@445 = ~I'm glad that you're here with me too, Zakrion.~
@446 = ~Hmph, well, if I had it my way, you'd still be suffering because you made me suffer.~
@447 = ~We don't need to talk about the past. We can start anew.~
@448 = ~On a second thought, I don't think this relationship, or whatever we are, is a good idea.~
@449 = ~I guess it was too much to hope for.~
@450 = ~Sure, <CHARNAME>. I respect your decision, I just wish I had done things another way.~
@451 = ~I can't blame you for that, can I?~
@452 = ~I guess, I can't. Perhaps you can make me suffer later on your own terms?~
@453 = ~I partially agree with that. I think I need to remember the past, so I remember why I'm here with you.~
@454 = ~I'm very happy to be at your side, <CHARNAME>.~
@455 = ~I thought I had made the right decision back when we were at Baldur's Gate... you know my reasonings, I think.~ 
@456 = ~Do you?~
@457 = ~I want to understand it better. Please tell me more.~
@458 = ~If you wouldn't mind telling me more, I would like to hear it.~
@459 = ~I'm unsure what was going through your mind at the time, but it didn't make sense to me. It still doesn't make sense to me.~
@460 = ~I still don't understand your reasonings, and I don't care to understand them.~
@461 = ~That makes sense to me. I guess we can put that part of our story aside.~
@462 = ~Are you sure there isn't anything you want to know?~
@463 = ~Yes, I am very sure.~
@464 = ~On second thought, I would like to know your reasonings.~
@465 = ~Fair enough, let's go.~
@466 = ~But I'd like to walk beside you as we travel. It... makes me smile, knowing that I am by your side once again.~
@467 = ~As I might've mentioned to you prior, I didn't think whatever we had would work out.~
@468 = ~I truly thought my love for the sea was all that mattered to me. A good pint of ale, Buttercup on my shoulder, the salty sea breeze, and captaining a mighty crew on a majestic vessel - that is what I wanted. To be frank, that is still what I want.~
@469 = ~However, I found myself thinking of you often, especially during those nights on the shit deck. That isn't very romantic, is it? Ignore the part about the shit deck; it's not important.~
@470 = ~You left me thinking... maybe, just maybe, it would be nice to have someone supporting me throughout these trying times. Someone to help lead the ship - a first mate.~
@471 = ~Sure, I could always try and weasel my way to getting my former first mate to come back to the ship, but he has a family.~
@472 = ~I remember Pentos, my former first mate, telling me about his beautiful wife at home, his children, his grandchildren, and his great grandchildren. Before you ask, he is some type of elf, I should probably know, but for some reason, I always forget.~
@473 = ~Anyway, Pentos always had a sparkle in his eye when he talked about his family. I assumed that I had that same twinkle in my eyes whenever I talked about my ship and the ocean. Maybe, I do, but I later learned that it isn't the same.~
@474 = ~So, here I am. Clearly, my plan wasn't to be captured by pirates, and then be rescued by you, but it worked out.~
@475 = ~So, you think there's something missing in your life, and that something is me?~ 
@476 = ~I'm unsure how to feel about all this.~
@477 = ~Thank you for letting me know, I appreciate it.~
@478 = ~It just sounds like you didn't want to be alone.~
@479 = ~I don't know if 'missing something' are the right words. I still don't know how to articulate it.~
@480 = ~I'm not expecting you to feel a certain about this; I'm not expecting anything, really.~
@481 = ~I only wanted to let you know.~
@482 = ~Far from it.~
@483 = ~It felt good to talk this over with you. I hope I clarified some things for you, and, if I didn't, we can talk about it more along the way.~
@484 = ~Come, let's get going, but I'd like to walk beside you as we travel. It... makes me smile, knowing that I am by your side once again.~


/* Romance Talk 2 - What happened with Irenicus? */
@485 = ~I don't think I ever got around to asking you what happened with Irenicus.~
@486 = ~I think you briefly mentioned the torture, and I can hear your frantic thrashing in the other room while we're all supposed to be sleeping. It must have been bad.~
@487 = ~Wow, you don't say. How insightful of you.~
@488 = ~It wasn't that bad, I've experienced worse.~
@489 = ~The question is: why are you awake so late at night?~
@490 = ~It was terrible, Zakrion. Everytime I close my eyes all I can see is Irenicus' face looming over mine.~
@491 = ~I don't want to talk about it.~
@492 = ~Yeah, yeah, I get the sarcasm in your voice.~
@493 = ~You're the type of woman to say that you don't feel too much, even when you stick your entire head into the searing heat of an oven.~
@494 = ~I've experienced some less favorable things, too. Sometimes, it keeps me awake.~
@495 = ~Ah, I was afraid you were going to say that, but what did I expect?~
@496 = ~What about this: I talk about what the tortures I endured with the pirates who captured me, and you tell me about the tortures Irenicus put you through.~
@497 = ~Does that sound fair?~
@498 = ~This isn't some competition, Zakrion. Irenicus hurt me in ways you couldn't even imagine.~ 
@499 = ~Alright, fine, but you have to go first.~
@500 = ~If you insist on me talking about it... I'll tell you. It was terrible, Zakrion. Everytime I close my eyes all I can see is Irenicus' face looming over mine.~
@501 = ~If you really must know, it wasn't that bad. I've experienced worse.~
@502 = ~Stop pushing me. I don't want to tell you about it.~
@503 = ~I wasn't trying to make it a competition. I thought relating to you would make you be more open to me.~
@504 = ~No. I think it would be better if you shared your experience first.~
@505 = ~I think you're wrong. I think you should tell me first.~
@506 = ~You're really putting me on the limelight right now, aren't you?~
@507 = ~It feels like I'm walking the plank on top of the shit deck.~
@508 = ~I'm sorry. I didn't mean to push you. As I've said before, I just thought talking about this kind of stuff helps you to digest the reality of it.~
@509 = ~Maybe when you're ready to talk about it, I'll be here. Otherwise, you don't need to force yourself to tell me. By the looks of it, you don't want to tell me.~
@510 = ~And that's alright. I will respect that.~
@511 = ~I thought it might be a good idea for you to talk about what happened with Irenicus to me. My father told me it was good to talk about the experiences that have the most impact on us.~
@512 = ~I might've misjudged, and, maybe, it wasn't a big deal to you. It's also possible you don't want to talk about it, and that's perfectly fine. You shared enough with me already, and I think I get the gist of your experiences with Irenicus.~
@513 = ~I can't say I had a worse torture than you, but I do know I don't thrash around at night and wake up in a sweat... most of the time.~
@514 = ~I don't really know how many days passed when I was in that secret passageway or whatever I was in. It had to have been at least a week, two weeks max.~
@515 = ~It wasn't my worst experience, but it definitely goes into the category of "Let's not". My most traumatic experiences for me are definitely the ship crashes... but that's beside the point, you already know about them.~
@516 = ~But what you don't know is the torture I experienced at the hands of my captors.~
@517 = ~You don't have to talk about it, if you don't want to.~
@518 = ~Your pain cannot be compared to mine. We feel things differently, and your pain is as valid as mine. There is no competition of 'who suffered more than the other'.~
@519 = ~I would be a hypocrite of my own words if I didn't talk about it when I'm the one asking you to talk.~
@520 = ~Yeah, we do feel things differently, and what I feel is valid.~
@521 = ~I just don't think our levels of pain are equivalent. A prick on my finger makes me feel pain for a little bit, and I might even learn to be more careful, but having a finger broken is much more different. It's much more painful, and you'll think about it a lot more.~
@1417 = ~Although I wish the only torture I experienced during my captivity was pricked fingers.~
@522 = ~Punches and kicks were in the picture.~
@523 = ~Some knives may have been used, too.~
@524 = ~And the usual threats of being castrated. Lucky for me, you didn't give them a chance to do that.~
@525 = ~But there is one particular instance that keeps me up at night.~
@526 = ~They had some liquid in a mug, a very large mug. I thought there might have been acid in there or some toxins that they would force me to drink or splash on my face.~
@527 = ~They dashed some of the unknown liquid on my face, and I thought to myself, "There goes my face," but it was just water...~
@528 = ~I remember the smirks and laughs on the pirates' faces. Those laughs were so mirthful, as if they were celebrating a large festival, and a king's jester was entertaining the crowd.~
@529 = ~What they did instead... they placed the mug on its side, and instead of all the liquids spilling out quickly, little water droplets trickled out in a continuous beat. It's as if those droplets knew when to come out of the mug, and they timed their jumps at precisely the right moment to create that steady beat.~
@530 = ~I recall laughing at them - this was their torture? Surely, this was better than any physical torture. Surely, I could handle this!~
@531 = ~Please, continue.~
@532 = ~That was it?~
@533 = ~Unfortunately, there's more.~
@534 = ~I hadn't really experienced tortures of the mind, and this was the first.~
@535 = ~I don't know what the pirates did to make the room around me so eerily quiet, but all I could hear for hours on end was that constant dripping sound. Drip. Drip. Drip.~
@536 = ~I thought that sound would be comforting if I'm being frank with you. I love the ocean, I love the water, and the sounds of water? Absolute music to my ears, but this water wasn't crashing onto any shores. It fell in front of my feet with that constant dripping sound.~
@537 = ~The longer I listened to it, the louder and louder it became, until it was almost a deafening roar in my head.~
@538 = ~If you hadn't came when you did, well, let's say I'd be like that gnome Tiax at Baldur's Gate.~
@539 = ~I think I'd rather hear water dripping than have Irenicus experimenting on me. That's just my opinion, though.~
@540 = ~That sounds awful. I'm sorry you had to go through that.~
@541 = ~That doesn't sound too bad to me, but I can understand that.~
@542 = ~Ha! That's it? You've changed - you're more pitiful than I thought you were. It probably was a good thing that our relationship didn't get as far as it did.~
@543 = ~You're right. It was probably a good thing that our relationship ended when it did because you've changed for the worse.~
@544 = ~Well, this just goes to show that maybe a good memory should stay a memory.~
@545 = ~You're probably right, but it wasn't the best life experience for me.~
@546 = ~Now, I know that mental torture is just as effective as physical torture, maybe even more effective.~
@547 = ~Yeah, it probably wasn't as bad as what Irenicus did to you. Still, it wasn't the best life experience for me.~
@548 = ~The whole point of me telling you this isn't because I wanted you to pity me.~
@549 = ~It's because I want to let you know that as long as I'm around, that won't happen to you again.~
@550 = ~If I had been there with you when Irenicus captured you, maybe, just maybe, I could've been there to stop him. I won't know for sure, but I'm here for you now. I won't make the same mistake twice.~

@551 = ~This might be a dumb question to you, <CHARNAME>, but have you ever made any stupid decisions before? Any mistakes you'd like to laugh over with me?~
@552 = ~I never make mistakes.~
@553 = ~I always make mistakes, but I also know I need to learn from those mistakes.~
@554 = ~There's nothing laughable about the mistakes I've made.~
@555 = ~Oh, for sure. Let me tell you about that one time that I know you'll like...~
@556 = ~That's a dumb question; it's so dumb I don't want to answer it.~
@557 = ~Right. Okay.~
@558 = ~Even gods and goddesses make mistakes so there's no need to be afraid of admitting that they're times that you've fucked up.~
@559 = ~Yeah, that's a good way of thinking about it.~
@560 = ~Yeah, that might have been a little insensitive of me to say.~
@561 = ~I just hope you know I don't mean any offense by my question.~
@562 = ~Ha! You were right - I did like that.~
@563 = ~Suit yourself.~
@564 = ~I always think we should laugh about mistakes... after we've fixed them, of course.~
@565 = ~I used to beat myself up for making the tiniest of mistakes, and my father would take me aside and say to me, "You're going to make mistakes every day. That's life. Are you going to beat yourself up every day for the rest of your life? No, but what you can do when you make those mistakes is laugh about them. That way, you'll have a smile on your face every day".~
@566 = ~My old man was right, but it took a while for his words to sink in. Frankly, I still struggle with his words. There are varying levels of mistakes, and it seems like I always make the biggest ones.~
@567 = ~Starting with my first ship crash, then you, then my second ship crash. My mistakes with you and my second ship could've been avoided if I had just learned from my first mistake.~
@568 = ~As you've said, you shouldn't continuously beat yourself up for the mistakes you've made in the past. The only think you can do is learn from it.~
@569 = ~Looks like to me, everywhere you go, you're prone to making mistakes.~
@570 = ~I like your father's outlook on making mistakes. It's bound to happen, and the only thing you can control at that point is the expression on your face.~
@571 = ~Yeah, that doesn't look or sound too good.~
@572 = ~You can't change what's in the past. All you can do is look forward.~
@573 = ~I think your father is wrong. You need to remember what you've done incorrectly every day. That's how the world needs to think. Instead, we blame everyone else for our troubles.~
@574 = ~Yeah, I know.~
@575 = ~I've been down that road, <CHARNAME>. It has brought my mind to a lot of dark, depressing places.~
@576 = ~I would not suggest that route, and I would only suggest that route to those that understand the mental toll of punishing yourself every day. I don't know many people with a strong willpower or, at least, that kind of willpower.~
@577 = ~I'd like to say my father was a wise man, and I know he made a lot of mistakes in his life. One of those mistakes was leaving my mother alone for days on end until she couldn't love him anymore.~
@578 = ~I thought I learned from that mistake. I guess, I was wrong.~
@579 = ~I didn't know you were such a hopeless romantic!~
@580 = ~For what it's worth, Zakrion, you did what you thought you had to do with the knowledge you had at the time.~
@581 = ~It's a lesson learned.~
@582 = ~Hmph, I'm glad you suffered.~
@583 = ~Wait, you made a mistake like this before. Otherwise, you wouldn't have said you thought you learned from your mistake. Care to elaborate?~ 
@584 = ~I wouldn't really call myself one, not with what I've done in the past, but, maybe, if you think so.~
@585 = ~No, I should've said and done things differently with you.~
@586 = ~It is a lesson I should've learned a while ago.~
@587 = ~Suffering? I wouldn't call how I felt suffering. It was more like wistfulness.~
@588 = ~Yeah, you're right. It's uncanny how you're able to sniff my life out before I can even get it out of my mouth. That just adds to your strength, I think.~
@589 = ~I met a young woman at a fishing village about a few years ago.~
@590 = ~She was a lovely woman, and she knew how to tie a good knot. I like to brag that my knots are the strongest knots you'll ever face, and no one could ever untie them - I learned them from her.~
@591 = ~We both knew I wasn't going to be with her for very long, but she asked me to stay and live with her in her small fishing village. I couldn't, though.~
@592 = ~There was more of the world that I needed to see, and my love for the sea could not be beaten. I don't regret leaving her and her village, though. I wish I had said and done things differently.~
@593 = ~I wish I had treated her with more respect towards the end instead of turning a cold shoulder and ignoring her. I still remember the pain in her eyes, and it's not a good feeling hurting someone that I shared some good moments with.~
@594 = ~She may not have been someone I could see myself with, but that doesn't give me the right to hurt her as I did. It's things like this, where all those relationships in the past and mistakes you've made along the way, make up who we are today.~
@595 = ~I wouldn't change those things because I think they make me a better person, and I'm constantly learning.~
@596 = ~I want to be the best version of myself for you, <CHARNAME>.~
@597 = ~So I'll continue to learn for the both of us.~

/* Romance Talk 4 -  Meeting with His Mom */
@598 = ~Well, that was my mother. Sorry, <CHARNAME>, I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that.~
@599 = ~Frankly, I didn't think she would be in the city. I didn't think I'd ever see her again.~
@600 = ~I didn't know she was writing me letters all these years either... I suppose I can't be bitter towards her when I'm the one who made it difficult for her to reach me.~
@601 = ~It was a pleasure meeting your mother. She seems like a good person.~
@602 = ~It is what it is. At least I got to meet one of your parents.~
@603 = ~That wasn't the best experience, but I can tolerate your family members.~
@604 = ~Let's not do that again. I have no desire to see your mother and your stepfather for as long as we're in Athkatla.~
@605 = ~I'm glad you think so.~
@606 = ~Yeah, I would've liked for you to have met my father, but that's not possible.~
@607 = ~Thanks. I wasn't expecting to see my mother in Athkatla after all those years... but it makes sense; she always loved the big city.~
@608 = ~She's the only family I have, <CHARNAME>. Please understand that. You don't have to come with me when I see them, but I will still visit them regardless.~
@609 = ~And to think: I have a brother! A half-brother but a brother, no less.~
@610 = ~I don't know how to feel about this all. I'm stunned. I'm excited, but I feel like I've belly-flopped into the ocean.~
@611 = ~I'm happy for my mother; I truly am, but I wonder why she couldn't have stayed for me. Was I not important enough to her?~
@612 = ~I'm sure she had her reasonings. I think she really loved you, and she loves you now. You are her son, after all.~
@613 = ~You shouldn't be so hard on yourself or your mother. You don't know the entirety of her circumstances.~
@614 = ~I don't know, but I don't think you should dwell on the past.~

@617 = ~Yeah, I guess, you could be right.~
@618 = ~I feel like she did that when I dig deep into it.~
@619 = ~But I know it's not true.~
@620 = ~It's just hard for me not to think like that when she moved on with her life. There's no doubt she loved my father and she loves me, but I wonder how different my life could've been if she had stayed.~
@621 = ~I don't think my father would've went down the path of piracy, but I don't think he would've been there for my mother when she needed him.~
@622 = ~I think my mother would've stayed a broken woman.~
@623 = ~Maybe this was for the best. She's happy, and that's what I want for my mother.~

@632 = ~Have you tried feeding her other food like some chunks of dried meat?~
@633 = ~Keep your animal quiet! It's annoying, and its screeching is hurting my ears.~
@634 = ~Can you please keep her quiet?~
@635 = ~Yeah, what <CHARNAME> said. When <CHARNAME> makes a promise, <PRO_HESHE> is going to keep it.~
@636 = ~Shh. Don't tell her that.~
@637 = ~She does eat other things, but she hasn't had a buttercup in weeks, and that's her favorite.~
@638 = ~First, Buttercup is not an *it*. Buttercup is a *she*, and she deserves some respect.~
@639 = ~I'd highly suggest treating her with respect, <CHARNAME>.~
@640 = ~She's an animal. If she was out in the wilderness, she would've already been eaten.~
@641 = ~You're right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to you, too, Buttercup.~ 
@642 = ~She is nothing but a hindrance. Actually, as the group leader, I demand you get rid of her.~
@643 = ~Look, <CHARNAME>. You may be captain of this crew, but, as a captain, you should treat your crew mates with respect. They help to run the ship. Without the crew, you have no running ship.~
@644 = ~Buttercup is a valued member of this crew, and, if you intend to make me get rid of her because you think she's less than any of us, you're sadly mistaken.~
@645 = ~Good luck finding your extra crew members because this is something I will not tolerate. Let's go, Buttercup.~
@646 = ~*Hiss.*~
@647 = ~Survival of the fittest is a real thing, especially within in the wilderness, but you forget that Buttercup was created with the most optimal features in mind.~
@648 = ~She could probably survive better than any of us out there in the woods. She has saved me from many starving nights - that's for sure.~
@649 = ~*Mrrrroooow.*~
@650 = ~Yes, I know. I need to repay the favor.~
@651 = ~I'm trying, but she's really hungry right now. Well, she's hungry for buttercups in particular.~
@652 = ~You know, some say the way a person treats an animal is a good reflection on who they are as person.~
@653 = ~When I was much younger, I once knew a boy who would go out of his way to stomp on small critters.~
@654 = ~He would put on these very heavy boots, boots that would create a loud clunking noise when they hit the ground. If he saw a helpless baby bird or tiny rodent while on his way back from wherever he was going, he'd trample the critter until they were nothing but a pile of fur... or feathers.~
@655 = ~He mentioned that he liked the squelching sound from his boots, probably from the guts he was trampling on. He didn't grow up to be anything terrible though. I had a random encounter with him during one of my excurions on land, and he lives his life as a normal person does... but it makes you wonder what devious urges does he have lurking at the back of his mind?~
@656 = ~I'm just glad I found Buttercup when I did too. I couldn't imagine what someone, like that animal-stomping boy from my past, would do to her. Buttercup is quite trusting, maybe it's the primate side of her recognizing us, because we're not all that different.~
@657 = ~You sound like some sort of druid or ranger. Maybe you need a career change.~
@658 = ~That's an interesting way of thinking. I'll need to think more on it.~
@659 = ~I think your words hold some truth. At the end of the day, we're all trying to survive with what the world has given us.~
@660 = ~There is a clear distinction between a rodent and me. Don't make that comparison again. Humans are different than the common animal.~
@661 = ~The woods aren't for me. You can't see things the way you can see things on the vast, bountiful ocean.~
@662 = ~We are different from the 'common animal', and I don't know why the gods and goddesses gave us the ability to be more intelligent.~
@663 = ~But, sometimes, I think humans are worse than animals. We have the power to balance between good and evil, but we are so bull-headed and think it's our way or no way.~
@664 = ~Nature is certainly harsh, but one simple fact of it all remains: everyone is trying to survive.~
@665 = ~People, specifically the nobles, survive and thrive. There's nothing wrong with that, and, if I'm honest with myself, I'd probably do the same. It's weird... this world we live in, where the worth of a living being is tied to the amount of coins jingling in their purse.~
@666 = ~As much as there is strife in this world, I find it's the little things that I'm the most appreciative of. Buttercup and her love for buttercups. The salty wind on my face on top of the shit deck. The smell and taste of salbread. Walking beside you...~

@677 = ~You're a remarkable woman, <CHARNAME>. There are times at night where I think to myself, "Why couldn't I let our course flow?", because the outcomes might've played out differently.~
@678 = ~At the end of the day, I need to remind myself that decision I made was for the best for me at the time. I've learned to control that feeling, but the gods and goddesses have led me back to you.~
@679 = ~I think this is a sign. The ocean's call to me has always enticed me and has always led me back to her, but your calling is a tidal wave. It spins me around and around until I don't know which direction I'm going.~

@688 = ~Ha! Sucks for you, because I never wanted you. I only wanted to see you beg for my forgiveness.~
@689 = ~I wasn't expecting you to say that.~
@690 = ~I had my chance with you, and I messed it up. So, I understand, but it's still not what I was hoping to hear.~
@691 = ~You are... a wonderful woman, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry I could not be what you wanted me to be.~
@692 = ~You continue to baffle me every day.~
@693 = ~I will not beg for your forgiveness. I am not here to lick your boot and worship the ground you walk on.~

@864 = ~That's not what I meant, but I have been with other humans before and some halflings, if you need to know.~

@941 = ~I don't believe it when someone says it's love at first sight. Well, unless you're charmed, then yeah, that definitely exists.~
@942 = ~But, at the end of the day, isn't love at first sight just a person who finds themselves very attracted to the other person? Probably by their looks first because how deeply can you really know someone at first glance?~

@947 = ~Sure, it would be flattering, but, just for your sake, I hope you didn't.~
@948 = ~Yeah, I'm glad you think so.~
@949 = ~Frankly, I'm not exactly sure where all this is coming from; it wasn't supposed to be a rant - that's for sure.~
@950 = ~I'm going to tread carefully with my words here: I want us to build something strong. I don't want our relationship to be based on trivial things or forever be in the 'honeymoon' state, as folks call it.~

@1208 = ~It's possible that you're not meant to be a pirate lord. Have you thought about that?~

@1223 = ~I don't know what happened today. My brain froze, my hands froze... I felt like I was falling into a never-ending pit.~

@1225 = ~But, as soon as I stepped outside of his abode and took a breath of fresh air, the anger came back to me, and I felt like I was missing something.~
@1226 = ~I felt so much... guilt? Disappointment? For lack of better words, I felt like shit.~
@1227 = ~At that moment, I felt like that was my biggest failure. I felt like I didn't deserve to stand where I stood - to have the life I have, to be by your side.~

@1233 = ~Well, if you don't like who you are at this moment, then the next step is to improve that.~
@1234 = ~I really don't care about this whole dramatic spiel with Desharik and your revenge for your father. You've shown me that you are weak and pathetic. Those aren't good traits for a captain or anybody.~
@1235 = ~You're right. Those traits aren't good for anybody, but, damn, your words are harsh.~
@1236 = ~I can't say that you're wrong for thinking that way, though. I failed myself, I failed my father, I failed you, I failed everybody.~

@1441 = ~I don't know. Open it up, and let's see for ourselves.~
@1442 = ~It looks suspiciously like a hand; maybe it contains strawberry filling?~
@1443 = ~Ew. Put that back on the ground. Why would you pick that up?~
@1444 = ~Hold on a second, let's see what's inside... ~
@1445 = ~Yeah, that sounds like a good idea... ~
@1446 = ~For fuck's sake, sink me - it's a hand! But it's so small... ~
@1447 = ~<CHARNAME>, we should go after that halfling man. I don't know where he went, but we need to follow him. Damn, he was fast. We would need a clipper to catch up to him.~
@1448 = ~I'll keep this hand for now. We might need it to find that man.~
@1449 = ~I'll make sure to wrap this hand with a lot of cloth. The smell reminds me of salted pork... and not the good kind. I don't have a great nose for this stuff so maybe rotten, salted pork isn't the best scent description for it.~

@1460 = ~Uh, sure. I suppose we can take a look around here.~
@1461 = ~Are you really going to listen to a half-cat, half-monkey creature? You do realize she's an animal, right?~
@1462 = ~No, we don't have time.~
@1463 = ~I'm not about to waste my time listening to her yowls. Shut her up, Zakrion, or I'll do it for you.~
@1464 = ~You forget Buttercup is the product of a wizard experiment! She must have some magical capabilities, like amazing eyesight or a very sharp sense of smell!~
@1465 = ~There's no harm in looking around. That's all I'm asking.~

@1330 = ~(He lets his lips linger over yours before reluctantly pulling away.)~
@1331 = ~You are... a remarkable woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@1332 = ~(He enthusiastically returns your kiss, but, before you are able to pull away, he leans over and whispers into your ear.)~

@1337 = ~Like what you see?~
@1338 = ~(He gives you a funny look and raises an eyebrow at you.)~
@1339 = ~(Without looking, he deftly steps away and pretends that you didn't just try to assault his foot.)~
@1340 = ~(He feigns a surprised look when you step on his foot.)~
@1341 = ~If you keep stepping on my foot like that, I'll be out of commission for the rest of our quests!~
@1342 = ~(Right before your foot can land on his, he twirls around and steps on your other foot.)~
@1343 = ~On guard!~
@1344 = ~Thanks?~
@1345 = ~(He looks oddly at you.)~
@1346 = ~(He returns your pat on the back with a good, strong smack of his own on your back.)~
@1347 = ~(He claps your back in friendly camaraderie.)~

@1351 = ~Have you seen her swipe a butterfly in midair? It's very impressive.~
@1352 = ~*Mrrrow.*~
@1353 = ~She's half monkey and half cat. She was abandoned by some wizard, and I found her eating buttercups near a garden.~
@1354 = ~I don't like saying that I chose her or saved her because she's the one that chose me.~
@1355 = ~Ha! I thought you'd never ask.~
@1356 = ~This one is on you, right?~
@1357 = ~This one is on me, <CHARNAME>.~

@1364 = ~(When his lips reach the corner of your lips, he mutters something that you can't seem to understand.)~
@1365 = ~(You look upon Zakrion, a rather tall, young man. You watch as he flexes his arm in an attempt to loosen some of his muscles.)~
@1366 = ~(He's not built as a mountain, but he has enough muscles that, when he stretches, they ripple across his arm. However, it isn't his lean muscles that catch your attention but the deftness of his hands and feet.)~
@1367 = ~(Each of his steps, as he moves to and from his stretching position, are calculated and precise. You notice he never puts his entire foot flat on the ground but merely bounces from the top of his feet to their soles.)~
@1368 = ~(Additionally, his hands are always moving; it seems like he is constantly fidgeting, but, to the untrained eye, you know his hands are going through the quick movements of swordplay.)~

@1376 = ~(He sticks out his leg and shakes it.) That's my leg.~ 
@1377 = ~(He retracts his leg and raises one of his hands in the air.) That's my hand.~
@1378 = ~(He uses two of his fingers to open his eyes wide and stares straight at you.) This is my eye.~
@1379 = ~(He tucks his loose strands of hair behind his ears and exaggerats the presence of his ears with his hands.) This is an ear. A human ear to be exact.~
@1380 = ~There is nothing out of the ordinary here, <CHARNAME>.~
@1381 = ~Crew, not team.~
@1382 = ~I'm glad to be in the crew, <CHARNAME>.~
@1383 = ~Thanks, it feels good knowing that you think I'm useful.~
@1384 = ~It's good to be on the team.~
@1385 = ~I'm glad to have a great captain.~
@1386 = ~I'm glad to have a great captain... and a beautiful one, too.~
@1387 = ~(He clasps your hands in his as an act of friendship.)~
@1388 = ~(He stares down at your intertwined hands and smiles to himself.)~
@1389 = ~(His thumb gently presses into your palm as you two hold hands for what seems like ages.)~
@1390 = ~(After walking a few steps, he stops in his tracks and lifts your hand up to his lips.)~

@1394 = ~(He pretends not to notice you.)~
@1395 = ~(He holds his head up high as the two of you walk together in unison.)~
@1396 = ~(He allows you to easily slip your arm into his, and you both press on like this for a long while.~
@1397 = ~(Before your arm can reach his, he abruptly turns and walks away.)~
@1398 = ~Ha! It's nice to see you, <CHARNAME>.~
@1399 = ~(He gives you a mock expression of pain.)~
@1400 = ~There's more where that came from.~
@1401 = ~(He rolls his sleeves further back up his biceps and flexes his arm.) There you go, go ahead and bite that.~
@1402 = ~I appreciate your appreciation.~
@1403 = ~Hey!~
@1404 = ~(Before your hand can make its way to Zakrion's bottom, you can see his butt clenching quite visibly.)~
@1405 = ~I'm always ready for your attacks.~
@1406 = ~You think you're going to get away with doing that?~
@1407 = ~Think again.~
@1408 = ~(His hand catches yours mid-swing and with his other hand, he gives your rump a sharp, hard slap.)~
@1409 = ~Two can play at that game.~
@1410 = ~(He awkwardly pats you on the back.)~
@1411 = ~I guess we all need a hug from time to time.~
@1412 = ~(He buries his head in your hair and takes a deep breath.)~
@1413 = ~You are intoxicating.~
@1414 = ~(He holds you tightly in the embrace.)~
@1415 = ~(He doesn't say anything and lets the time pass.)~
@1418 = ~Zakrion, I wanted to talk about a conversation we had prior. I've made my decision.~
@1419 = ~Yeah? What's the verdict?~
@1420 = ~I want you in my life.~
@1421 = ~I don't need or want you in my life.~
@1422 = ~I could not be happier to hear that. Lady Luck truly smiles upon me.~
@1423 = ~Yeah, I figured if it took you this long to decide, then something must have gone awry.~
@1424 = ~At least now, I have my answer.~
